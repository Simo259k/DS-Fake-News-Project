# Part 4 - Evaluation (~1 page)
You should now evaluate your models on the FakeNews and the LIAR dataset. Arrange all these results in a table to facilitate a comparison between them. You should be evaluating the model on how well it classifies articles correctly using F-score. You may want to include a confusion matrix to visualize the types of classification errors made by your models.

## Task 1 
Evaluate the performance of your Simple and Advanced Models on your FakeNewsCorpus test set. It should be possible to achieve > 80% accuracy but you will not fail the project if your model cannot reach this performance.

## Task 2 
In order to allow you to play around cross-domain performance, try the same exercise on the LIAR datasetLinks to an external site., where you know the labels, and can thus immediately calculate the performance. You are expected to directly evaluate the model you trained on the FakeNewsCorpus. In other words, you do not need to retrain the model on the LIAR dataset.

## Task 3
Compare the results of this experiment to the results you obtained in Task 1. Report your LIAR results as part of your report. Remember to test the performance of both your Simple and Advanced Model on the LIAR dataset.
