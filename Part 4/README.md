## How to run Part 4
To execute the cells in "Part 4/Task_1_2_3_simple_model.ipynb", you first need to insure, that you have executed the cells in the preivous parts. This means that you should have a file called "WITHOUT_NUM_cleaned_file_with_labels.csv" in your working directory. 

Furthermore, you need to have downloaded the LIAR dataset (https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip). From this you need to have "test.tsv" in your working directory.
