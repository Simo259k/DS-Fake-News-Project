# Guidelines for processing of code
First and foremost you'll need a fresh enviorment, or make sure you have nothing in your enviorment that will disrupt the code. Then you'll need to "pip install -r requirements.txt", and with that all the libaries you'll need to run the code is there. The requirements.txt installs all libaries, because most of them are dependencies that scikit-learn, nltk and seaborn needs to function properly. When you install scikit-learn, nltk and seaborn, pip automatically installs the other libraries (if they arenâ€™t already present) to satisfy the dependencies.
