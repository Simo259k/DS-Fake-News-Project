# Guidelines for processing of code
First, create a fresh virtual environment or make sure your existing environment does not contain conflicting packages. Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries. The `requirements.txt` file includes the packages scikit-learn, nltk, and seaborn, which will automatically pull in their dependencies if they are not already present. This ensures you have a clean, consistent setup to run the code without conflicts.

Then, ensure that your directory is empty to avoid any filename conflicts.

PART 1
- First you'll have to download the sample of the FakeNewsCorpus [FakeNewsCorpus][(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus/master/news_sample.csvLinks to an external site.)]
- Do not have a file with the name "cleaned_file.csv" saved beforehand in your directory
