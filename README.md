# Guidelines for processing of code
First, create a fresh virtual environment or make sure your existing environment does not contain conflicting packages. Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries. The `requirements.txt` file includes the packages scikit-learn, nltk, and seaborn, which will automatically pull in their dependencies if they are not already present. This ensures you have a clean, consistent setup to run the code without conflicts.

PART 1
- Make sure to have the 99500K NewsCorpus downloaded before running the script. [FakeNewsCorpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus/tree/master)
