# Guidelines for processing of code
First, create a fresh virtual environment or make sure your existing environment does not contain conflicting packages. Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries. The `requirements.txt` file includes the packages scikit-learn, nltk, and seaborn, which will automatically pull in their dependencies if they are not already present. This ensures you have a clean, consistent setup to run the code without conflicts.

PART 1:
- Make sure to have the 99500K NewsCorpus downloaded before running the script. [FakeNewsCorpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus/tree/master)
- Do not have a file with the name "cleaned_file.csv" saved beforehand in your directory

Part 2: 
To execute the cells in "Part 2/Task_0_1_2_3" and "Part 2/More_exploration.ipynb", you first need to insure, that you have executed the cells in Part 1. This means that you should have a file called "cleaned_file.csv" in your working directory. Also, "output_big.txt" should also be in your working directory. However, this file shold already be present.
