    "### Now try to explore the 995K FakeNewsCorpus subset Download 995K FakeNewsCorpus subset. Make at least three non-trivial observations/discoveries about the data. These observations could be related to outliers, artefacts, or even better: genuinely interesting patterns in the data that could potentially be used for fake-news detection. Examples of simple observations could be how many missing values there are in particular columns - or what the distribution over domains is. Be creative!"

    "#### Describe how you ended up representing the FakeNewsCorpus dataset (for instance with a Pandas dataframe). Argue for why you chose this design\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to represent the FakeNewsCorpus dataset using a Pandas DataFrame because the data was already in CSV format with columns like id, domain, content, and metadata. Using a DataFrame made it straightforward to load the entire table into memory, even though it has nearly a million rows, and provided an easy way to clean, filter, and analyze the data using built-in functions. This design was chosen because it simplifies the data tasks in this task: we could quickly compute statistics, check for missing values, and even visualize distributions without writing a lot of code. Even though our computers sometimes struggles with very large files and can handle different sizes, Pandas lets us process the data in chunks, so we could easily work on a subset of the data and then combine the results. So we chose Pandas, because it turns this messy CSV data into a table that is easier to understand and work with, and it has all the tools that we needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Did you discover any inherent problems with the data while working with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially attempted to load the entire dataset using pd.read_csv with low_memory=False to address the DtypeWarnings (especially in columns 0 and 1, which indicated mixed data types), but this approach overwhelmed our system and caused it to crash. We had to kill the process. Recognizing that our computer couldnâ€™t handle the full dataset at once, we switched to a chunk-based approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Report key properties of the data set - for instance through statistics or visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we added some coding so we could see even more statistics.\n",

    "# Accumulate content lengths for later statistics\n",
