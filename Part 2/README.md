## How to run:

To execute the cells in "Part 2/Task_0_1_2_3" and "Part 2/More_exploration.ipynb", you first need to insure, that you have executed the cells in Part 1. This means that you should have a file called "cleaned_file.csv" in your working directory. Also, "output_big.txt" should also be in your working directory. However, this file shold already be present. 

## Requirements:

Also, make sure that you have the following packages installed:

-   seaborn==0.13.2
-   scikit-learn==1.6.1
-   nltk==3.9.1

These packages can be installed via pip with the following command:

pip3 install -r "Part 2/Part_2_Requirements.txt"
