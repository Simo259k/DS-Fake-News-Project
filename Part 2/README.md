--- 

## How to run:

To execute the cells in "Part 2/Task_0_1_2_3" and "Part 2/More_exploration.ipynb", you first need to insure, that you have executed the cells in Part 1. This means that you should have a file called "cleaned_file.csv" in your working directory. Also, "output_big.txt" should also be in your working directory. However, this file shold already be present.
