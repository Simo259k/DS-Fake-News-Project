,,,reliable,,"Betsy Arakawa, wife of Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, died from a respiratory illness linked to hantavirus, a rare disease transmitted by infected rodents, officials have confirmed. Health experts warn that hantavirus can cause flu-like symptoms after exposure to rodent droppings, and in severe cases, it may develop into Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a life-threatening lung condition. Medical investigators believe Ms Arakawa contracted HPS, which led to her death. It is believed she died a week before her husband, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities discovered the deceased couple in their New Mexico home last month. Here's what you need to know about hantavirus. Hantavirus refers to a strain of viruses carried by rodents, primarily transmitted to humans through inhalation of airborne particles from dried rodent droppings. Infections typically occur when the virus becomes airborne from a rodent's urine, droppings, or saliva, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Though rare, it can also spread through rodent bites or scratches. In North America, deer mice are the most common carriers, according to the Mayo Clinic. The virus can cause two severe illnesses. The first, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - the most common strain in the US - was the illness that led to Ms Arakawa's death, officials say. Symptoms often start with fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, followed by headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal issues. If respiratory symptoms develop, the mortality rate is approximately 38%, according to the CDC. The second illness, Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome, is more severe and primarily affects the kidneys. The CDC reported 864 cases of hantavirus in the US between 1993 and 2022. Most of the cases were found in rural areas of western states like California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. The agency began surveillance for hantavirus diseases in 1993 during an outbreak of severe respiratory illness near the Four Corners region of the US where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah all meet. There may be around 150,000 cases of Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome worldwide each year, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health. More than half occur in China. There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infections. The CDC recommends supportive care to treat symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms may need to be admitted to hospitals in intensive care units. Some may need to be intubated in severe cases. The CDC recommends eliminating contact with rodents in homes or workplaces to reduce exposure to the virus. The agency also recommends sealing entry points in basements or attics where rodents may enter homes. Wearing protective gear is also suggested when cleaning up rodent droppings to avoid inhaling contaminated air.",,,,"What is hantavirus, disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife?","Rachel Looker, BBC News, Washington",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, is seen as the most likely successor to Justin Trudeau as the leader of Canada's Liberal Party. Does he have what it takes to be the face Canada's ongoing battle against President Trump's tariffs? Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job. But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he is widely seen as the most likely successor in the contest to replace Trudeau, which comes to a head on Sunday evening local time. If he wins, he will become Canada's prime minister during one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. But holding onto that role will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October but many expect it to be called imminently, possibly right after a new Liberal leader - who would automatically become prime minister - is sworn in. Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smit, in the Northwest Territories. The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister. In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis. Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was transparent about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. That move would end up being widely praised for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England. In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"". Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour. From 2011 to 2018, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage. He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. His political ambitions have been rumoured for years but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea. ""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012. Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation. Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post. Now, both Carney and Freeland - who happen to be personal friends - are running to replace him, with Carney pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods. ""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.""",,,,Britain's former top banker eyes Trudeau's job,"Ben King and Robin Levinson King, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon, UK and Toronto, Canada",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu. That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico. For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is ""pretty set in stone,"" even if the tariffs themselves are not. ""I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,"" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. ""I think it's an important thing to do."" This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war. Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's ""I Am Canadian"" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's ""51st state"" rhetoric. ""We're not the 51st anything,"" declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada. Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal café changing the Americano on their menu to a ""Canadiano"" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country. Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming ""the 51st state"", as Trump has suggested many times. The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of ""treason,"" ""sedition"" and even ""betrayal"". Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done. After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown ""too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'"" Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes. ""I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person,"" he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump. ""He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies,"" Ford said. Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table. ""You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand,"" said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, ""but what does that mean?"" he asks. ""Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day."" The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist. The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses. Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto. ""The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment,"" Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are ""not going to want to spend a dime anywhere"" until they have some clarity. Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion. That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November. Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018. While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karen Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for ""families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison"". Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become ""the 51st state."" ""What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,"" Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday. Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally. The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest ""undefended"" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty. ""We've been allies for 100 years,"" he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine. ""We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies,"" Prof Gillezeau says. ""I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see."" The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State. Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (£15.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone. Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that ""Canada needs to find friends elsewhere"".",,,,"Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on","Nadine Yousif and Ali Abbas Ahmadi, BBC News, Toronto",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The remains of an indigenous woman murdered by a serial killer have been found after a search of a landfill in the Canadian province of Manitoba, police say. Morgan Harris' remains were recovered at the Prairie Green Landfill, north of the city of Winnipeg, said officials. Authorities had been searching for Ms Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26, both of Long Plain First Nation. Police say two sets of remains have been found. Ms Harris and Ms Myran were among four indigenous women killed in 2022 by convicted murderer Jeremy Skibicki, who dumped their bodies in two different landfills over a three-month span. The search of the Prairie Green Landfill began late last year following a lengthy pressure campaign by indigenous leaders. Cambria Harris, Morgan Harris's daughter, said in a Facebook post on Friday that the discovery of her mother's remains was a ""very bittersweet moment"". ""Please keep our families in your hearts tonight and every day going forward as we trust this process,"" the post said. Police initially declined to search the landfill, and a federal government study concluded that a search could take three years and cost up to C$184m (£100m; $128m), with workers exposed to hazardous chemicals. Manitoba eventually pledged C$20m to search for the remains - funds that were matched by the federal government. Skibicki was convicted in July last year of the murders of Ms Harris and Ms Myran, as well as of killing a third woman, Rebecca Contois, 24, of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, and a still-unidentified woman who has been given the name Buffalo Woman. Their murders went undetected for months until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki's apartment found partial human remains, identified as belonging to Ms Contois. Canada has long faced a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indigenous women make up 10% of the population of missing women in Canada and 16% of female homicides.

,,,reliable,,"Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman died of natural causes about a week after his wife Betsy Arakawa, who died after contracting a rare virus, a New Mexico medical investigator has said. Hackman, 95, died at his Santa Fe home from coronary artery disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease a contributing factor. Ms Arakawa, 65, died in the same house from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Her cause of death was listed as natural. Authorities believe she passed away about seven days before her husband, to whom she had been married for more than 30 years. During his career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven. It is likely that Ms Arakawa died first on 11 February, Dr Heather Jarrell of the New Mexico Medical Investigator's Office told a news conference on Friday. She said it was ""reasonable to conclude"" that Hackman had died on 18 February. Ms Arakawa's last known movements and correspondence were on 11 February, when she was seen going to a grocery store, a CVS pharmacy and a pet store, before returning home in the early evening. Given that Hackman was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease it is ""quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased"", said Dr Jarrell. She told reporters she was ""not aware of his normal daily functioning capability"". Hackman had ""significant heart disease, and ultimately that's what resulted in his death"", Dr Jarrell said, adding that he had had chronic high blood pressure. He had not eaten anything recently, but had shown no indications of dehydration, she added. At the news conference, New Mexico Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps emphasised that hantavirus infections were extremely rare. HPS is transmitted through contact with rodent droppings, urine or saliva, often when contaminated dust is inhaled. She noted that 136 cases had been reported in the state over the past 50 years, with 42% resulting in fatalities. Dr Phipps said evidence of rodent activity had been found in some buildings on the property, though the risk inside the main house was considered ""low"". Investigators are trying to determine how Ms Arakawa contracted the illness. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus. The couple were found in their home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through the window. The remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Hackman's body was in a sideroom next to the kitchen, with a walking cane and a pair of sunglasses nearby, according to a search warrant affidavit. Ms Arakawa's body was in the bathroom, with scattered pills close to her. Sheriff's deputies found medication for thyroid and blood pressure treatment, along with pain reliever Tylenol, according to a court-filed inventory. Citing privacy laws, authorities did not disclose who had been prescribed the drugs. One of the couple's three dogs was also found dead inside a crate near Ms Arakawa, while the other two dogs were alive. The cause of death for the dog is yet to be determined, officials say. Dr Phipps told reporters that dogs did not get sick from hantavirus. Initial investigations found no signs of forced entry or foul play at the couple's $3.8m (£3m) home. Tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative, and no significant gas leaks were detected. Hackman is survived by three adult children from his previous marriage. Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported. He won best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992. A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman saw his breakthrough come in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970. Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing an FBI agent in Mississippi Burning. He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein. His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",,,,Actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa died of natural causes one week apart,"Samantha Granville, BBC News, Los Angeles",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"It may have been drowned out this week as US President Donald Trump walked back tariffs on his closest neighbours - and biggest trading partners - almost as soon as they were in place. But despite the dizzying back-and-forth with Canada and Mexico, the White House made clear that it is serious about its economic vision. And it is willing to pay the price of some short-term economic harm to pursue it. ""There'll be a little disturbance,"" Trump warned in his address to Congress on Tuesday. ""But we're okay with that."" Some scepticism about that comfort might be understandable, given the abrupt policy turns on tariffs Trump has made, as financial markets dropped and the outcry from US businesses intensified. Those who see Trump's tariff threats as economic bluster might be tempted to conclude that he wants to talk tough, but flinches at the first signs of economic damage. But that view is to some extent undermined by the trade war against China he started in his first term which has seriously intensified. In just a few weeks, Trump has raised taxes to at least 20% on all Chinese imports. It means the average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, because taxes on some sectors - like electric vehicles and steel - stand at much higher rates. The 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods hasn't completely gone away either. The levy still stands on goods that aren't compliant with a trade deal that Trump negotiated in his first term - and so some goods coming from both neighbours will still be subject to it. The White House also says its much-touted reciprocal tariffs targeting nearly all US trade partners are still in the pipeline. The details, they say, will be unveiled on 2 April, with rates tailor-made to address whatever policies other countries impose that officials consider unfair - whether in the form of taxes on US tech firms, Value-Added Taxes, or other import rules. ""It's a certainty – reciprocal tariffs are coming,"" Trump's senior adviser on trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro told business broadcaster CNBC on Friday. He said the White House had seen signs that its threats alone were prompting car companies to start taking action and bolster their supply chains in the US - exactly the kind of investment that Donald Trump says his tariffs will spur. ""They're getting the picture,"" Navarro said. Navarro and others say the nitty-gritty of tariff rates is not their focus. Rather, they are using trade levies as a means to create a new version of America, where the country has a different relationship with its global partners. That America has more local manufacturing, a smaller government and pays less for the military defence of its allies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - a former Wall Street hedge fund boss not known as a tariff hawk - this week pointed to political discussions in Germany about boosting its military spending as an ""early, big win"". ""The international trading system consists of a web of relationships - military economic, political. One cannot take a single aspect in isolation,"" he said, as he tried to sell the administration's strategy to a tariff-sceptical audience at the Economic Club of New York. ""This is how President Trump sees the world - not as a zero-sum game but as inter-linkages that can be re-ordered to advance the interests of American people."" For Trump, tariffs are a key tool for re-ordering that web. And the treasury secretary made clear that the likely short-term harm - higher prices - is an acceptable trade-off. ""Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,"" Bessent said. For now, polls indicate Trump's voter base remains behind him.

The person who died in New Mexico was a resident of Lea County, about 50 miles (80km) from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak appears to be centred. Officials did not provide the person's sex or age. One in every five measles cases requires hospitalisation and about three in every 1,000 cases results in death, the New Mexico health department said on Thursday. The current outbreak killed a healthy but unvaccinated six-year-old in Texas, state officials said on 27 Feb. While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US often sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases. Still, the two deaths are jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded anyone killed by measles since 2015. The 2015 death was the first one attributed to measles in the US since 2003. Three months into 2025, the total number of reported infections in the US has already climbed above 220. There were 285 cases over the entire year of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC has said it is monitoring the current outbreak, which is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community in Texas with low vaccination rates. While the outbreak is mostly occurring in Texas and New Mexico, measles has also recently been found in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington according to the CDC. Canada is also seeing a spike in infections, and recorded more cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2024, the country's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Thursday. Measles has been found in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which Dr Tam attributed to travellers who were exposed to the disease in another country. As of Thursday, there were 227 measles cases reported this year in Canada and most of those who became ill were not vaccinated, according to the country's public health agency. The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and they also immunise people against mumps and rubella. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is known in part for being a vaccine sceptic - published an editorial on Sunday expressing his concern about the growing measles outbreak.

,,,reliable,,"Former Olympic snowboarder and Canadian national Ryan Wedding, 43, has been placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list for allegedly running a violent transnational drug trafficking network. Wedding is wanted for allegedly shipping hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and southern California, to Canada and US locations, and for orchestrating multiple murders and an attempted murder to further these drug crimes. The US is offering a reward of up to $10m (£7.7m) for information leading to Wedding's arrest or conviction. Investigators believe he is living in Mexico, but have not ruled out his presence in the US, Canada, other Latin American countries or elsewhere. It was not clear if he has a lawyer. Wedding competed in Giant Slalom snowboarding for Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. His aliases include ""El Jefe,"" ""Giant,"" ""Public Enemy,"" ""James Conrad King,"" and ""Jesse King,"" the FBI said. In June 2024, Wedding and his accomplice Andrew Clark, 34, also Canadian, were charged in California with running a continuing criminal enterprise, committing murder in connection with the enterprise and assorted drug crimes, and conspiring to possess, distribute, and export cocaine. Clark was arrested last October by Mexican authorities and was among 29 fugitives extradited to the US from Mexico last week. The US indictment alleges that Wedding and Clark directed the 20 November 2023 murders of two family members in Ontario, Canada, in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment that passed through southern California. Another family member survived the shooting but was left with serious physical injuries, the FBI said. Wedding and Clark allegedly also ordered the murder of another victim on 18 May 2024 over a drug debt, according to the FBI.

,,,reliable,,"A SpaceX rocket exploded shortly after it was launched from Texas on Thursday, grounding flights and triggering warnings about falling spaceship debris. SpaceX confirmed the un-crewed ship had suffered ""a rapid unscheduled disassembly"" during its ascent into space, and lost contact with the ground. The massive SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever created, spun out of control shortly after its launch. No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky. This was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure. The spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earth's orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight. Its Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad. SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for ""pre-planned contingency responses"". The statement added that SpaceX would review data ""to better understand [the] root cause"" of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of ""several"" engines. ""As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability."" The statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe they've found any remnants of the craft. Musk has yet to comment on Thursday's explosion. The accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris. A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a ""space launch incident"". The incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceX's Texas facility. The FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris. After January's incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. ""Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now,"" SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday. This latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating January's explosion, according to US media reports. A statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would ""continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands"". Footage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris. Starship is the biggest, most powerful rocket ever built, and is key to Musk's ambitions for colonising Mars. SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket - collectively referred to as Starship - is intended to be fully reusable, the company says. Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon. In the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back - about a nine-month trip each way.",,,,"SpaceX rocket explodes, raining debris from sky for second time in a row","Max Matza, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Adnan Syed, whose criminal conviction was made famous in the hit true-crime podcast Serial, will not have to serve any additional jail time after being resentenced in the murder of his ex-girlfriend. A Baltimore judge ruled that Syed ""is not a danger to the public"", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News, and that ""the interests of justice will be served better by a reduced sentence"". Syed was convicted in the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison. His case spawned the Serial podcast, which questioned key evidence in the case and helped lead to his resentencing. Syed's conviction in the murder case still stands. His resentencing was possible under a law that allows for sentence reductions for people convicted as minors and have spent more than 20 years in prison. Baltimore City Circuit Judge Jennifer Schiffer made the ruling in court on Tuesday. Syed and Min Lee were classmates in high school in Maryland when Lee disappeared in January 1999. Her body was found in a forest three weeks later. Syed, then 17, was found guilty of first degree murder in February 2000, and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors at the time alleged Syed carried out the crime after becoming jealous of Lee's new relationship after the two broke up. In 2014, Syed's case gained national attention through the true-crime podcast 'Serial', which was listened to by millions of people. The podcast raised questions about the evidence provided by prosecutors and witnesses that appeared at his trial, and it explored the effectiveness of Syed's attorney. Fans of the podcast have donated more than $80,000 to Syed's legal fund, according to CBS News. Syed was cleared of all charges in 2022 after prosecutors said he had been wrongfully convicted. But his conviction was reinstated a year later in 2023 after an appeals court found that the lower court had failed to give the victim's brother sufficient notice of the hearing that freed Syed. Judge Schiffer's ruling on Tuesday allows for Syed to remain free.

,,,reliable,,"Hunter Biden has told a federal judge he is facing severe financial difficulties and cannot afford to move forward with his lawsuit against a former aide to President Donald Trump. The son of former President Joe Biden sued Garrett Ziegler in 2023, accusing him and his non-profit Marco Polo of breaking the law by publishing an online database containing 128,000 emails taken from a laptop attributed to Mr Biden. Mr Ziegler has previously dismissed the lawsuit as ""completely frivolous"". In a court filing on Wednesday, Mr Biden's attorneys asked US District Judge Hernan D Vera to end the lawsuit, stating that he ""has suffered a significant downturn in his income and has significant debt in the millions of dollars range"". Mr Biden has also faced a series of financial setbacks, with January's wildfire in the Pacific Palisades - where he was staying - making his rental home ""unliveable"" for an extended period, according to the court papers. Along with struggling to find stable housing and deal with fire damage, Mr Biden is having difficulties earning a steady income, according to the filing, and major sources of money have dried up. Mr Biden is unable to borrow and sales of both his art and his memoir - his two major income streams - have fallen off over the last 18 months, according to the filing. He had sold 27 pieces of art for an average price of $54,500 in the years leading up to the lawsuit. He has sold only one piece for $36,000 since. Book sales for his memoir, Beautiful Things, dropped from more than 3,100 copies between April and September 2023 to roughly 1,100 in the following six months. Mr Biden also has other lawsuits currently working through the court system and is assessing which ones he believes are worthwhile to continue, according to the filing.

,,,reliable,,"Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study. Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York. A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations. However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken. The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly ""abundance"" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes. This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts. Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species. The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%. ""While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,"" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University. Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US. The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled. ""That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,"" Prof Grames said. Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers. Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems. They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species. Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses. ""Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,"" Prof Grames explained. The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection. Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery. ""Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,"" Prof Grames said. She also stressed the need for government action.

,,,reliable,,"President Donald Trump is considering an executive order that would shut down the US Department of Education - a long-cherished goal of conservatives. The move would deliver on a promise he made on the campaign trail. Trump plans to end some of the department's programmes, while others would be housed within different parts of the government, according to US media reports. The Republican president will direct his newly confirmed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department"" based on ""the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law"", according to a draft of the order seen by the Wall Street Journal. Abolishing the department entirely requires an act of Congress, however. Established in 1979, the Department of Education oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students. Trump and his allies have accused the agency of ""indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material"". In December, he nominated former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his pick for education secretary. A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts. The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university. It also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty. And the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools. The department's allocation was $238bn (£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget. The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments. In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil. On his own, no. Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot. Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to gain necessary support. A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no. Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves. An earlier draft of Trump's order to dismantle the education department, obtained last month by the Washington Post, acknowledged that only Congress can get rid of the agency outright, but executive action could direct the agency to begin to wind itself down. Education department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce. The idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed. During Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled. Republicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities. More recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as ""woke"" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race. Trump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools. Conservatives argue that other education department functions, such as administering loans, should be handled instead by the US Department of Treasury, and that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.",,,,What does the Department of Education do - and can Trump dismantle it?,"Ana Faguy, BBC News, Washington DC",,,,,,,1

Officials believe the party is buried in up to 100ft (30m) of snow, but no bodies have yet been recovered after Tuesday afternoon's incident in the Chugach mountains about 40 miles (65km) east of Anchorage. The skiers, who have not yet been identified, were flown in by helicopter as part of a commercially guided trip, according to Alaska State Troopers. A fourth person in the group reportedly escaped the disaster. If the deaths are confirmed, this would be the deadliest US avalanche since three climbers died in Washington state's Cascade mountains in 2023. ""We are sorry to report an avalanche resulting in multiple fatalities in the west fork of the Twentymile River yesterday afternoon,"" the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Information Center said on Wednesday. ""Details on this accident are still emerging, and we will share more information as it becomes available. Our sincere condolences go out to the friends and families of those involved."" Alaska State Troopers said the skiers had all come from other states to the mountain near Girdwood, close to Alaska's largest resort, Alyeska. A spokeswoman for Chugach Powder Guides, which took the men on the excursion, told the Anchorage Daily News that witnesses had seen all three deploy their avalanche airbags, devices that inflate to help skiers stay on the surface of a snowslide. The avalanche is estimated to have been about half a mile long, sliding about 2,000ft down the peak. Using beacons, which transmit a radio signal to rescuers in the event of an avalanche burial, guides were able to locate ""a probable area where skiers were buried between 40ft and nearly 100ft deep"". ""The guides were unable to recover the three skiers due to the depth,"" the statement says. The rescue was called off due to limited daylight and because storms were expected to bring more snow and wind, heightening the risk of another avalanche.

,,,reliable,,"Republicans will move forward with their vote to punish the Texas Democrat who was ejected from Congress for disrupting President Donald Trump's chamber address on Tuesday. Congressman Al Green's fellow Democrats attempted to block the vote to censure the 77-year-old, with some arguing his decision to stand, wave his cane and heckle Trump was a legitimate act of protest. All Democrats voted to table the censure vote, but their motion failed to overcome Republicans' thin majority - 209-211-1. Green voted present. Even when facing punishment in the House, Green said his protest was ""worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up"" to Trump. Republican congressman Dan Newhouse of Washington introduced a resolution on Wednesday to censure Green, which would mean a formal reprimand for breaching chamber decorum. A vote is expected in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the behaviour of Green and other Democrats who also jeered at the president ""completely disgraceful"". But Green's actions were greeted by some on the left as a welcome sign that Democratic lawmakers were willing to fight Trump after the party's resounding election defeat in November. ""When security searched [Green], they found that he smuggled a spine,"" anti-racism activist and author Ibram X Kendi posted on Instagram to his over one million followers. But Green's behaviour also seemed to illustrate Democrats' uneven response to the Trump administration, which has frustrated many of its supporters as the president moves quickly to enact his agenda. Since re-entering the Oval Office, the president has signed dozens of executive orders, moved to fire thousands of federal employees, and banned diversity, equity and inclusion programmes from the government.

,,,reliable,,"The US Supreme Court has rejected a request by the Trump administration to withhold nearly $2bn (£1.6bn) in payments to foreign aid organisations for work they have already performed for the government. On Wednesday, the top court upheld a lower court ruling ordering the administration to release the funds to contractors and grant recipients of the US Agency for International Development and the State Department. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has cut numerous aid programmes and placed most USAID staff on leave or dismissed them. Aid agencies argue these actions have jeopardised life-saving operations worldwide. Last month District Judge Amir Ali had ordered the State Department and USAID to pay the bills to contractors for the work already done by midnight on 26 February. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration sought an emergency relief from the Supreme Court, arguing it was impossible to process claims in an orderly fashion in such a short period of time. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a brief administrative stay, before the full court acted on President Trump's request. On Wednesday, the top court in a narrow 5-4 decision declined to halt the lower court order that required the Trump administration to release the payment. The court said that Judge Ali's deadline for the immediate payment had now passed, and the district court should ""clarify what obligations"" the administration must fulfil to comply the order. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented with the order. ""Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?"" Justice Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. ""The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned."" The case began when two aid groups challenged Trump's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Judge Ali initially paused the cuts while reviewing the case, later ordering payment for completed work after the government failed to comply. Legal proceedings continue, with a district court hearing set for Thursday on contractors' requests for extended relief. The Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative, aims to shrink the federal workforce. USAID cutbacks have already disrupted global aid efforts, freezing hundreds of programmes in dozens of countries.

We're angry."" Her comments come after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called that a ""very dumb thing to do"" and announced retaliatory tariffs. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump would ""probably"" announce a deal to reduce tariffs on Wednesday. In response, Joly told the BBC that ""at the end of the day, the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump"". She said no Trump administration secretaries had contacted their Canadian counterparts on Monday or Tuesday about tariffs. Trump and Trudeau, however, are expected to speak over the phone on Wednesday morning, according to sources who spoke to CNN and the Toronto Star. Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on 4 February, but delayed implementation until 4 March. Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff. Ontario Premier Doug Ford implemented a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from Canadian power. Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on goods worth more than $800 (£645) from China in February, which doubled in March. China responded with its own tariffs. The White House said when it introduced the tariffs that it was ""taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country"". Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year. Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US. Canada had introduced new border security measures in December, in response to Trump's tariff threats before he took office. ""We didn't want this trade war.

,,,reliable,,"In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office. He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called ""appalling waste"" in government spending. BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. Trump said he inherited an ""economic catastrophe"" from Biden. This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7. On rising prices, Trump added ""we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country"". Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed. The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office. Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s. Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he ""let the price of eggs get out of control"". Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US. Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024. The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (£780m) plan to help combat the issue. The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them. Trump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found ""hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud"" in federal government spending. No evidence has been provided for this figure. On its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings. However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published ""receipts"" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings. US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m. Speaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that ""as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded"". This is true. In February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol. This is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000. By comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.

,,,reliable,,"It's the first night of the Rodeo in Houston, Texas - usually an unmissable event in the city. But gathered at an Irish pub in the suburbs of the city are a group of young Republicans who don't want to miss US President Donald Trump's prime-time address to Congress. About a dozen members of the party have piled into the back room of the pub while Fox News blares on surrounding TV screens. People have come out wearing red, white and blue, with flag pins and scarves to accessorise. Before the speech started, members of the club told me how excited they were to hear Trump's policy proposals. If they had to give him a grade on the first 44 days in office, it was a unanimous ""A+"". ""He's already surpassed all expectations,"" one person told me. As the president took to the podium, the group chatter stopped, but the cheering and laughing did not. Sporting a Trump-Vance baseball cap, Evan Howard, 26, raised his glass every time the President said something he agreed with. And that was a lot. ""He's going to crack down on crime and be tough with cartels. He'll stop a lot of American bloodshed,"" he said. But Evan conceded that, 44 days in, he's not feeling the benefit of President Trump being back in office. At least, not yet, and he's happy to wait. ""I'm not too much better off, to be honest, but I like what he's doing,"" Evan said. ""I see the work that's being done, and I understand that some of these changes that he's putting through are not going to go through right away, and that we will see their effects in the future."" Seated across from Evan was Brittany, who was far less expressive throughout the event than the rest of the table. A 31-year-old black woman, she's new to the Republican Party. ""I think he did great. I thought it was a very unifying message,"" she said. ""He pointed out a lot of things that the Democrats, who I used to feel really connected to at one point, have failed to press on. ""[The Democrats] tend to advocate for certain things that don't really apply to Americans as a whole. Americans are struggling. You have issues with crime, you have people losing their home, you have people becoming homeless. And the liberals want to talk about pronouns."" Mentions of pronouns, gender, and ""wokeness"" garnered a lot of cheers and claps from the crowd on Tuesday night. The boos came every time the cameras panned to Nancy Pelosi, or Democrats holding signs in the crowd, or any lawmaker looking sleepy in the crowd. In her solemn rebuttal speech to Congress, Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin warned US democracy was ""at risk"". ""It's at risk when the president decides you can pick and choose what rules you want to follow, when he ignores court orders and the constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand by and just let it happen,"" she said. She also took aim at the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who she said was combing through Americans' private information with a ""gang of 20-year-olds"" from his White House team known as Doge. But Slotkin's remarks appear to have had little effect on the Republicans gathered in the Texas bar. The only feedback for Trump tonight?

,,,reliable,,"Elissa Slotkin, a US Senate Democrat, gave her party's response to Trump's congressional address, taking the new Trump administration to task for bringing with it chaos and recklessness. Early in her remarks, she attacked the White House on the economy and warned that if Trump was ""not careful, he could walk us right into a recession"". Slotkin also took a shot at the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting project led by Elon Musk, saying change is needed ""but doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe"". Speaking from Michigan before a backdrop of US flags, Slotkin was much more concise and much less animated than the president, who regaled Republicans on the House floor for an hour and 40 minutes. She made a quick reference to Democrats' stinging election defeat in November, but then quickly pivoted to Trump. ""Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change,"" she said. ""But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy."" Throughout the election, voters frequently said the economy was their number one concern, and Democrats' defeat was blamed on not addressing it sufficiently. Weeks into Trump's presidency, economic concerns remain high, as prices of a number of goods have not dropped, and prices on some items, like eggs, have risen. ""Grocery and home prices are going up, not down – and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either,"" she said. Slotkin also talked about immigration, another topic where Democrats poll worse than Republicans, highlighting a lack of empathy by the Trump administration toward undocumented immigrants. ""The border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants,"" she said. She cited the public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday during a meeting withTrump and Vice-President JD Vance, too. ""That scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world,"" she said. ""He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth."" For many, Tuesday night was their first time meeting Slotkin, who won the US Senate seat in the swing state of Michigan last year. A former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst, Slotkin became the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate at 48, when she won her seat in a state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost last November. Slotkin gave her speech after Trump's, which is not a traditional State of the Union address but was expected to serve the same purpose. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Slotkin a ""rising star"" in the party last week as he announced her as the pick to provide the Democratic Party's rebuttal. He said she was ""great on both economic and national security"" topics. Slotkin is new to the Senate, but she served in Congress as a member of Michigan's delegation to the House of Representatives. She was first elected in the Democrats' 2018 wave of success, flipping a Republican seat. Prior to her political career, she held a variety of government jobs. She held national security positions in Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama's administrations. She served in Bush's National Security Council, and, under Obama, she served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs and in the State Department. The CIA recruited Slotkin, who is fluent in Arabic and Swahili, shortly after she earned a graduate degree in international affairs at Columbia University in New York City. She served three tours in Iraq as a CIA analyst. The moderate Democrat focused her 2024 Senate campaign on lowering costs for Americans, a move that helped propel her to a narrow victory over former Congressman Mike Rogers, even as Trump won the state.

,,,reliable,,"Six weeks into his presidency, Donald Trump came to a US Capitol controlled by his Republican Party to take a lengthy victory lap. ""We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started,"" he told the joint session of Congress. In typical Trumpian hyperbole, he said that ""many"" believed his to be the most successful start to a presidency in US history. He noted what he said was a change in the national mood toward ""pride"" and ""confidence"". He compared himself to George Washington, and boasted about the size of his electoral victory. The whirlwind start to his presidency offered plenty of material for Trump to cover, and he didn't shy away from it. He ticked through a lengthy list of tangible accomplishments – hundreds of executive orders and actions, a freeze on foreign aid, lower levels of illegal border crossing, and the withdrawal from international organisations and agreements. He also spoke at length about his ban on transgender athletes in women's sports and moves to get ""woke ideology"" out of US schools and the military. ""Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone, it's gone, and we feel so much better for it, don't we?"" Meanwhile, Democrats – who filled up half the audience in the House chamber – sat in icy silence, as the president repeatedly blamed them, former President Joe Biden and ""radical left lunatics"" for all the nation's ills. Several dozen responded by holding up small black signs with words like ""false"" and ""lies"". The president seemed to enjoy putting the ""bully"" in the presidential bully pulpit. He needled his political adversaries, mocking their refusal to cheer his remarks, dusting off his ""Pocahontas"" nickname for Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, and wryly noting that attempts to prosecute him ""didn't work out"" for his opponents. Texas congressman Al Green was not around to see any of that, however. At the very start of Trump's speech, the Democrat had harangued the president, his mostly inaudible comments punctuated with repeated thrusts of his cane. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson called for decorum and the House Sergeant-at-Arms escorted the congressman from the chamber. Green would tell reporters outside the Capitol that he was protesting proposed cuts to the government-run Medicaid health insurance for low-income Americans. After about half an hour of touting his opening actions, Trump turned to the tasks he still needed to accomplish. That made up the bulk of a speech that stretched for more than an hour and 40 minutes. It was standard presidential address fare, and Trump's rhetorical flourishes began to blur together. While he said ""small business optimism"" was up, he blamed Biden for the current state of the economy – including high egg prices. He promised to ""rescue"" the economy and make getting ""dramatic and immediate relief to working families"" his highest priority. He called out Elon Musk in the audience, and said his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) would reduce inflation by cutting wasteful spending and fraud, prompting him to recite a laundry list of purported examples in foreign aid and other government programmes. Trump leaned heavily into promises of further progress on immigration enforcement and offered an animated defence of his tariff policies, saying that they were ""protecting the soul of our country"", even if most economists warn they will lead to higher prices for American consumers. The president acknowledged that adding a tax on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China might cause a ""disturbance"" and that US farmers might feel a ""period of indigestion"". But nothing in his comments suggested that he was backing away from a budding trade war that has roiled the stock market in recent days - in fact, he promised to move forward with reciprocal tariffs on all US trade partners next month. Trump once again promised to balance the budget, prompting a round of applause from Republican legislators. He provided no details about the kind of steep cuts such a promise would require, however. In fact, he quickly turned to discussing the tax cuts he hopes Congress will enact – including his campaign promises of no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security. Any of those, if enacted, would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the current nearly $2tn budget deficit. Foreign policy is rarely front and centre in these presidential addresses, and that was the case this time despite how Trump has shaken up global politics in the first weeks of his second term. He repeated his desire for an American annexation of Greenland, promised American control of the Panama Canal and only made brief mention of Gaza and the Middle East. The president spoke more extensively about negotiating with Russia for peace in Ukraine. And he took pleasure in reading from a letter he said he'd just received from Volodymyr Zelensky - which was similar to a message the Ukrainian leader posted on X earlier in the day.",,,,Trump says he is 'just getting started' in speech to US Congress,"Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent•@awzurcher, •",,,,,,,1

Green, a Democratic lawmaker from Houston in Texas, stood up and shouted 'Mr President, you don't have a mandate!' just minutes into Trump's address, referring to Medicaid cuts. He was immediately drowned out by Republicans shouting ""U-S-A!,"" before House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered his removal from the chamber. Green is a fierce critic of President Trump, and called for the impeachment of the president during his first term in office. Speaking to reporters after he left the chamber, Green said he is willing to accept whatever punishment he is given for his actions. He doubled down on his message, saying Trump ""has no mandate to cut Medicaid"", and that he is preparing articles to impeach the president. ""This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for [the] poor,"" he said. Medicaid is the programme that helps cover medical costs for those with limited income and resources. It has become one of the biggest issues for Democrats concerned that about reductions to the programme. Trump has said Medicaid won't be affected, but achieving the widespread cuts Republicans promise could be difficult without cutting major social services. Several prominent Democrats such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Medicaid beneficiaries as guests to the joint address. New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went on Instagram Live after Trump's address, warning that Trump and the Republicans ""are coming for Medicaid"". Green was not the only Democrat who protested in the chamber. Several Democratic women were seen wearing pink dresses in protest of President Trump's policies, saying that rising costs are disproportionately affecting women. Others were seen wearing yellow and blue ties, to show their support for Ukraine, representing the colours of the country's flag. Trump said Monday that he is pausing all military aid to Ukraine, a few days after his spat with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.

Charges against them include child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery, attorney general Rob Bonta's office announced in a press release on Monday. Officials tallied 69 fights at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, California, from July to December 2023. An investigation into the brawls began after footage from one of the fights was leaked, leading officials to find 143 victims involved, ranging from 12 to 18 years old. Twenty-two of the 30 officers charged were arraigned on Monday, meaning they formally faced their charges in court. The other eight officers are scheduled to be arraigned in April. ""Officers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care,"" Mr Bonta said in the press release. Instead, he continued, the officers charged were ""overseeing 'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened"". The fights at the youth centre resulted in physical harm to the teens, according to the press release. The leaked video footage - published by the Los Angeles Times in April - shows a teen falling to the ground after sustaining punches and kicks from multiple others. The video shows officers inside standing nearby and watching, and they appear to occasionally laugh and shake hands with the assailants as the fights continue. ""Watching the video, the officers look more like referees or audience members at a prizefight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people,"" Mr Bonta said at a press conference on Monday.

Vance grew up in poverty, but went on to Yale Law School and rubbed shoulders with Silicon Valley elites before turning his life story into a politically tinged memoir which championed conservative values. He is a former US Marine who served in Iraq as a military journalist before becoming a sharp critic of American involvement overseas. And having once said he was a ""never-Trump guy"", he took office as Trump's deputy - and a steadfast Maga (Make America Great Again) loyalist. His current job also makes him the early frontrunner in the 2028 presidential race, when Trump will no longer be able to run under rules set out in the US Constitution. Trump, 78, is the oldest person ever to be sworn in as US president, and 40-year-old Vance is - as an old phrase goes - just a heartbeat away from the top job. But now the former Ohio Senator and self-described ""hillbilly"" faces perhaps his biggest test - keeping in with Trump and forging a role in the administration when Elon Musk has sucked up much more attention than the president's elected second-in-command. The pitfalls are obvious. The last Republican Vice-President, Mike Pence, dared to stand up to Trump by refusing to overturn the duo's 2020 election loss. Pence's subsequent bid to run for president crashed and burned, and he is now persona non grata in the Maga world. Vance will hope to avoid the same fate.

On his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that ""all federal funding will STOP"" for schools that permit students to protest illegally. Trump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). American students will be expelled, Trump said. Trump did not specify what would constitute an ""illegal"" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. ""Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,"" the statement said. The group added that the move will ""cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"".

""Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,"" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. McMahon added that ""unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled"". In January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. The order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to ""monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff"" and, if warranted, remove them. A White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to ""protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities"". In April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. Thousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. At Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building. Four months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned.

,,,reliable,,"Jay-Z is suing a woman who in February withdrew her legal action accusing the rapper of rape. His defamation action claims she ""voluntarily admitted"" being pressured into making false claims in what it describes as an ""evil conspiracy"" to extort money and damage his reputation. The anonymous woman filed her legal action in October and refiled it in December, accusing Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of raping her aged 13, after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Both rappers denied the allegations. Jay-Z's defamation action, filed at a federal court in Alabama, also accuses the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, and his co-counsel, David Fortney, of orchestrating her lawsuit. Mr Buzbee has garnered headlines internationally over the dozens of legal actions he has filed on behalf of people accusing Mr Combs of sexual misconduct, extortion, assault and other transgressions. Mr Combs has denied all the allegations. He is also facing federal sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Jay-Z's defamation action says the woman told his legal team her lawyers had made her make the false allegations. ""Buzbee brought Jay-Z into it,"" it says she said. And despite her admitting Jay-Z ""did not sexually assault [her],"" Mr Buzbee ""pushed [her] towards going forward"" with the false story to strengthen the case and extort more money, the defamation suit claims. Jay-Z's action also notes alleged discrepancies in the woman's interview with NBC News last year, including naming another celebrity guest at the MTV party, who had, in reality, been performing in a city thousands of miles away on the night. Her father also contradicted her claim he had picked her up after the alleged assault, it claims. Jay-Z's defamation action says Mr Buzbee's firm failed to vet the claims and the woman, who they say has a history of mental health issues and an assault charge. Mr Buzbee has denied any wrongdoing and claims Jay-Z's team tried to intimidate the woman into retracting her statements. In a statement obtained by BBC News, Mr Buzbee said Jay-Z's defamation action had ""no legal merit"". ""Shawn Carter's investigators have repeatedly harassed, threatened and harangued this poor woman for weeks, trying to intimidate her and make her recant her story,"" Mr Buzbee said. ""She won't - instead, she has stated repeatedly she stands by her claims.""

A meeting on Monday evening did not result in Mr Musk's expulsion, but it has drawn the world's oldest scientific academy into a divisive, political row.

Dean, who was famously private throughout his nearly 60-year marriage to Parton, died in Nashville, Tennessee, according to a statement she posted on social media. ""Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,"" the statement read. The 9-5 singer met Dean outside a laundromat on the first day she arrived in Nashville as an 18-year-old aspiring singer. Parton, 79, recalled their first meeting, saying, ""I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about."" Two years later, on May 30, 1966, the couple exchanged vows at a private ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia. Throughout their marriage, Dean remained out of the public eye, choosing instead to focus on his asphalt-paving business in Nashville. Though he largely stayed out of the limelight, Dean continued to influence Parton's work, most notably inspiring her classic hit Jolene. She told US media in 2008 that the song was about a bank teller who developed a crush on Dean. ""She got this terrible crush on my husband,"" Parton said. ""And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us—when I was saying, 'Hell, you're spending a lot of time at the bank. I don't believe we've got that kind of money.' So it's really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one."" Parton and Dean's relationship remained such a mystery that rumours started that he did not exist - but Parton joked about that. ""A lot of people say there's no Carl Dean, that he's just somebody I made up to keep other people off me,"" she said to the Associated Press in 1984. Parton and Dean had no children together.

,,,reliable,,"The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders. The extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being ""disrespectful"" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"". Trump also accused the Ukrainian president of ""gambling with World War Three"" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early. World leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think. This South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine. It never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump]. Zelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump. Some of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards. But Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else. This Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting. I had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise. They were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy. It's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected. I've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine. If more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. The majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing because I think they'd have a very different point of view. This war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs. Zelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did. Putin sitting there going, ""Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners."" This New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was ""disgusted"" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office. I was absolutely disgusted with it.

It is a surprise reversal for Robert Crimo III, who previously pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and attempted murder charges. Crimo, 23, entered his guilty plea on Monday moments before opening arguments were due to begin in his trial. He is accused of shooting at celebrating crowds from a roof in downtown Highland Park, about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north of Chicago. Authorities had arrested him on the day of the shooting after a manhunt. Crimo pleaded guilty before Judge Victoria Rossetti in a Lake County circuit courtroom, and did not say anything else before he was dismissed. According to the Chicago Tribune, the suspect's mother briefly interrupted after he pleaded guilty, resulting in the judge warning her that she could be kicked out of the courtroom. His trial was expected to last a month, with testimony from survivors and police. Crimo faces seven murder counts and a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. He is due to be sentenced on 23 April. Prosecutors said they also turned over thousands of pages of evidence, including a videotaped interrogation during which police say the suspect had confessed to the shooting. The victims killed in the shooting were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35. More than 40 others were injured, with victims ages ranging from their 80s to an eight-year-old boy who was left paralysed. Prosecutors during the trial said Crimo had disguised himself in women's clothing before he accessed a rooftop and opened fire on parade-goers. He then left the area, dropping his semi-automatic weapon. Authorities said Crimo had driven for more than two hours to Wisconsin after the shooting before he was caught by police.

,,,reliable,,"King Charles has met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, under the shadow of inflammatory statements made about Canada by US President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly spoken of making the neighbouring country the 51st state of America. He has also vowed to impose new import taxes on Canada, which is one of the US's top trading partners. Ahead of his meeting with the King at Sandringham, outgoing PM Trudeau said he would discuss issues of importance to Canadians, including ""standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation"". The King has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit him in what will be an unprecedented second state visit. As head of state of the Commonwealth nation, the King has faced calls to give Canada his vocal backing in the face of Trump's statements. Jason Kenney, the former leader of the Canadian province of Alberta, suggested Charles faces a difficult tightrope. Jason Kenney, a conservative who served as Alberta's premier, wrote on X that the King could only act on the advice of the Canadian PM, who ""should ask [Charles] to underscore Canadian sovereignty"". But the conservative politician then took aim at British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, whom he said had ""cravenly thrown Canada under the bus"" when he refused to comment on Trump's annexation threats during his visit to the White House last week. ""It was a shameful betrayal of a fellow realm which has made enormous sacrifices for the defence of Britain,"" Kenney wrote. New import taxes announced by Trump are also set to come into effect on Tuesday, targeting goods arriving from China and Mexico as well as Canada. The president is eager to protect American manufacturing and jobs, and to address the US trade deficit. He suggested in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that his country was effectively subsidising Canada by paying to import its products. Without this flow of capital, Canada ""ceases to exist as a viable country"", he wrote. Trump has previously spoken of using ""economic force"" to make Canada the 51st state of America. But he said he was not considering using military force - an assurance he has not given while stating his ambitions of taking the Panama Canal and Greenland. The question of how to respond to Trump's tariff threats and other statements about Canadian sovereignty has dominated the debate in Trudeau's Liberal Party, with candidates vying to replace the PM after he announced his resignation in January. On the other side of the Canadian political divide, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has also attacked Trump's statements. The King has found himself at the centre of a recent whirlwind of diplomatic meetings following Trump's return to the presidency - some of which relate to the war in Ukraine.

,,,reliable,,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States. It means government agencies and organisations that receive federal funding can choose whether they want to offer documents and services in languages other than English. It rescinds a policy that required such bodies to provide language assistance to non-English speakers signed by former president Bill Clinton in 2000. ""Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,"" the order says. This marks the first time the US has designated an official language at the federal level since the country was founded almost 250 years ago. It is noted in the order that agencies do not need to change, remove or stop offering any such assistance they already provide. ""In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream,"" the order reads. ""Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society."" It also says it celebrates the ""long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come"".

Republicans have previously tried to get English designated as the US's official language, with members of the House introducing legislation that failed in 2021. Those who opposed their efforts said an official language was not necessary given the high numbers of people who speak English without it being designated as such.

It was Vance who led the attack on Zelensky before Donald Trump joined the fray at the White House in a meeting that had been cordial until the vice-president spoke up to laud the president for seeking what he described as a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine-Russia war. ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?"" said Zelensky, who has been critical of direct talks between Washington and Moscow. ""What do you mean?""

,,,reliable,,"In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks. On Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die – the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade. With a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows. ""Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,"" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons. The US declared measles ""eliminated"" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus. The Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said. On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak ""not unusual"", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents. Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states. ""We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,"" Leah said. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off. She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus. ""It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles. That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles. Mr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life. ""With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,"" he said. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin. But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated. ""When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,"" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine. ""I share that concern with them,"" said Dr Malbari. Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now. He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to ""do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult"" to get vaccines. But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses. He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover. Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of ""informed consent"" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week. The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official. But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is ""what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination"". On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed. In addition to calling the Texas outbreak ""not unusual"", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses. Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades. ""It's a devastating disease,"" he said. ""And it's completely preventable."" For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch. Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds. ""If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,"" she said. But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days. Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure. ""In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,"" she said. Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said. ""We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,"" he said. ""It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.""",,,,RFK's measles response under scrutiny as deadly outbreak frightens Texas parents,"Madeline Halpert, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away. The impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. Each season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Remote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. ""I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,"" she says. ""That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience."" But one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened. As a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region. ""We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,"" she says. On any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. Now, those jobs are gone. She worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. Mass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff – around 1,000 workers - being forced out. The cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired. The cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year. Long queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well. A popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is ""due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees"" and ""will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels"". At Yosemite National Park, the annual ""firefall"" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff. Andria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she ""100%"" supports the protest. ""It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,"" she says. She says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect. Ms Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species. ""They both are in dire straits,"" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild. Staff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut. ""I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,"" she says. ""The future of conservation just feels very uncertain."" Long-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains. The email firing them and thousands of other staff cited ""performance"" issues – something they took issue with. ""Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,"" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic. He and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses – and never being paid more than $22 (£17.40) an hour. ""It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,"" Ms Thompson added. Following a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months. ""On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,"" Burgum told Fox News last Friday. ""But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit."" The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget. Outdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect. ""If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,"" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.",,,,Cuts to national parks and forests met with backlash,"Max Matza, BBC News, Reporting fromSeattle, Washington",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Donald Trump has clashed with Volodymyr Zelensky in a furious exchange at the White House, with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"". The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal. After relations first became strained over Trump's handling of Ukraine peace talks with Russia, the minerals agreement was supposed to be a stepping stone towards further security ties between the countries. But Zelensky was told by the Americans to leave before the deal could be signed. At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support, and that he was ""gambling with World War Three"". Zelensky had earlier argued there should be ""no compromises"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin - but Trump said Kyiv would have to make concessions to reach a peace deal with Russia. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory. The meeting to discuss the US-Ukraine deal, which involved access to Ukrainian oil, gas and rare minerals, came after the new US president appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier. His tone had softened in recent days, with Trump saying he had ""a lot of respect"" for the Ukrainian leader. But Friday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sat alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky responded by asking ""what kind of diplomacy?"", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east. The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and ""litigating"" the situation in front of the media. From there, the discussion escalated quickly, as Trump and Vance accused Ukraine's president of being ungrateful for three years of US support during the war with Russia, with Trump saying Zelensky was in no position to tell the US how it should feel. Not long after the meeting - and well ahead of the pre-planned schedule - Zelensky was seen leaving the White House in his official vehicle. Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, to say ""Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office"". ""I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" the Republican president continued. ""I don't want advantage, I want PEACE."" Zelensky also posted on social media, thanking the president and the US four times. In a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat ""was not good"" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged. ""Because the relations are more than just two presidents,"" he said, adding that it was also about ""strong relations between our two people.""

Jakody Davis and Lamon Freeman died following a gang-related shootout at Lamon's 13th birthday party in Atlanta, Georgia, last summer. And while city detectives did not name Lil Baby, real name Dominique Armani Jones, they said the boys had been innocent victims of a flare up of gang violence sparked by a ""cowardly rapper"" filming a video in rival territory. In a statement via lawyers, Lil Baby, who spent weeks in the UK charts for Band4Band with Central Cee, said he had ""absolutely no involvement"" and branded the comments from police ""shameful"". During a press conference on Wednesday, detectives from City of Atlanta Police said how Jakody and Lamon weren't the intended targets of the shooting at the Sparks Street apartment complex in the city on 2 July 2024. They detailed how the attack had been ""orchestrated"" from prison and involved members of ""one of the most hyperviolent gangs in the city of Atlanta"". Addressing reporters, Maj Ralph Woolfolk said ""the overall theme of this case is grown men playing gangster that left two of our children in graves and our communities in fear"". ""Lamon Freeman was allowed to be a teenager for 27 minutes before gang violence ultimately took his life, gang violence that was orchestrated by adults and cowardly acts of an Atlanta-based rapper."" The rapper, he said, ""decided to go over into a rival gang stronghold and shoot a music video in a place that he knew he should not have been. ""And in the subsequent days, we saw homicides and shootings and ultimately the deaths of two children as a result of his cowardly actions."" In the months before Lamon and Jakody were shot, Atlanta police said they responded to several people being shot during a video shoot. Nobody was killed but three men in their 20s were injured in the attack in the north west of the city on 14 May which was widely reported to have taken place on set for one of Lil Baby's videos.

,,,reliable,,"Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday making English the official language of the United States, according to White House officials. The US president is also expected to scrap requirements that federal agencies provide language services to non-English speakers. The US has never had an official language in the nearly 250 years since the country was founded. The order is intended to improve government efficiency and promote national unity, according to White House officials. Nearly 68 million of the country's 340 million residents speak a language other than English, according to the US Census Bureau, which includes more than 160 Native American tongues. Friday's executive order will roll back a policy from 2000 signed by former President Bill Clinton requiring government agencies and federal funding recipients to ""ensure that their programs and activities normally provided in English are accessible to LEP (low-English proficiency) persons"". Agencies will still be allowed to provide that language access to non-English speakers, according to White House officials. Republicans have led efforts in the past to label English as the country's official language, with members of the House as recently as 2021 introducing legislation on it that failed. Those who opposed those efforts say that the country does not need an official language, pointing to the high numbers of people who speak it and to the country never having one, while also saying establishing one could promote discrimination against non-English speakers. During his presidential campaign last year, Trump included non-English languages in his statements calling for stricter immigration policies. ""We have languages coming into our country. We don't have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language,"" he told a crowd of supporters in February 2024. ""It's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing,"" he said. And during the 2016 campaign he said, ""This is a country where we speak English. It's English. You have to speak English!"" When the US was founded, most residents spoke English and those writing the country's constitution did not feel it was necessary to enshrine it as the official language and also did not want to alienate fellow new citizens who spoke German or other languages, according to most scholars. The languages currently spoken the most in the US after English are Spanish, various Chinese languages, Tagolog, Vietnamese and Arabic, according to the Census Bureau. A further approximately one million people use American Sign Language, according to experts. Approximately 180 countries around the world designate official national languages, and most countries recognise multiple official languages.

,,,reliable,,"A California judge has said the mass firings of probationary employees by the Trump administration were likely unlawful. The ruling said the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had told thousands of employees across a handful of federal agencies they were fired using authority the agency does not have, US District Judge William Alsup ruled. ""[OPM] does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees at another agency,"" he said. ""They can hire and fire their own employees."" In court the government argued OPM asked, not ordered, the agencies to fire these employees. They also argued that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired. Government workers have been the target of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce in the name of cutting costs. Many employees affected by the firings are probationary employees - usually those in their first or second year in a job - though they can sometimes be long-time employees who were recently promoted. There are some 200,000 probationary employees in the federal workforce. Judge Alsup ordered OPM to revoke its directives to multiples agencies - including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Defence Department - to terminate employees. He issued a temporary restraining order which puts a momentary pause on the government's actions until a judge revisits the matter in the coming weeks. The case began after a coalition of labour unions and non-profit organisations sued the government, arguing OPM unlawfully fired individuals by falsely claiming workers were performing poorly.

Californian Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman said people across the US ""depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information"". NOAA weather data is used by meteorologists, media organisations, commerical forecasting services and other companies to inform the US public about the weather. The agency produces the latest information on temperature, precipitation, air quality, UV index, humidity and more. This data is used extensively in the private sector to fuel popular weather services and websites. ""Most or all private weather companies in US (including forecasts that you see on TV or your favorite app) are built directly atop backbone of taxpayer-funded instrumentation, data, predictive modeling, & forecasts provided by NOAA,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles wrote on X. The agency has proved essential during periods of extreme weather conditions as well. The National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service - housed under NOAA - create models and notify millions of Americans when and how to respond to severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Huffman lamented the loss of ""hundreds of scientists and experts at NOAA"" who helped collect infromation that kept the public safe during dangerous weather events. ""Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives,"" the congressman said. Miyoko Sakashita, the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans director, said gutting NOAA will ""hamstring essential lifesaving"" programmes. The latest developments come days after US government workers faced widespread confusion following conflicting advice over compliance with a Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination. The message sent to millions of federal employees last Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would ""shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week"". On Sunday, Musk said in some cases ""we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks"". In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information. But, key agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, the Pentagon and the FBI - now led by Trump appointees -instructed employees to ignore the directive. Agencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency encouraged their staff to comply, according to reports. On Wednesday, Musk reiterated the suggestion that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be ""dead"" or ""not real people"", but offered no facts to back it up.",,,,Hundreds in US climate agency fired in latest cuts,"Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, ""Where you from, ma'am?"" ""England."" ""Hope you enjoy Estelle,"" he says. ""Do you?"" I ask. ""A lot better than where I was before."" Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment. No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison. ""I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,"" he says. ""If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison."" Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The ""good time credit"" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well. Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation. Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison. ""They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,"" he says. ""I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works."" The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%). The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood. ""The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,"" Ms Mahmood says. ""They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s."" She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. ""It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime."" The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet. ""The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,"" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. ""And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.""",,,,UK looks at Texas supermax prison for ideas to cut overcrowding,"Sima Kotecha, Senior UK correspondent•@sima_kotecha, •",,,,,,,1

The Kuwati migrant, in his sixties, suffered a cardiac arrest on the boat that was carrying him and other migrants on Saturday, the Pas-de-Calais prefecture said in a statement. The boat returned to the beach and the man but despite the efforts of police and medics was declared dead at the scene, it added. He is the sixth person to have died while attempting to cross the Channel this year. The boat set off from Calais in northern France on Saturday morning and ""very quickly returned to the beach with a person in cardio-respiratory arrest on board,"" the French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP. ""This boat set off again once it had dropped off the people who wanted to disembark on the beach,"" it added.

Michael Keane, 38, began to verbally abuse his partner one month into their relationship before carrying out a campaign of physical abuse that lasted six months. Douglas Courthouse heard at one point he placed a mattress against the front door of her flat to make it difficult for her to leave. Passing sentence, Deemster Graeme Cook said he had subjected the ""vulnerable"" woman to ""appalling"" and ""degrading"" treatment. The court heard the couple had met in October 2023 on a night out. While they had initially divided their time between Keane's home in Liverpool and hers on the island, he went on to move in with her. The court was told Keane had begun verbally abusing the victim within three weeks of them meeting, and started regularly hitting her in November that year. He would then refuse to let her leave the flat until she covered up the bruises he had given her, the court was told. After being punched in the face by Keane on one occasion in April 2023, she ""crept out"" of the flat and called her sister, who encouraged her to report him to the police, the hearing was told. Keane was arrested, and later broke his bail conditions by letting himself into the woman's flat without permission and sending her threatening messages. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said she had never imagined someone that she thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with ""could hurt me in this way"".

,,,reliable,,"Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy. Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents. They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Here police found a ""treasure trove"" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment. They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his ""minions"", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial. The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as ""hooked and in love"" with her in WhatsApp messages. Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was ""sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information"". The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity. Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an ""extremely sophisticated"" operation that ""posed a threat to national security and individuals"". Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard. The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an ""intermediary for the Russian intelligence services"". Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations. Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm. Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname ""The Destroyer"". Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on ""British values"". But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past. During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia. Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested.

Ginny was 38 when she died in 1994 after being diagnosed with breast cancer but since then the charity she started has gone on to rescue almost 400 horses and ponies. ""She was my heroine, I was in absolute awe of her and I wanted to be just like her,"" said Dionne Schuurman, who was taught to ride by Ginny as a nine-year-old. Dionne, who is now operations manager at Ginny's charity Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, said Ginny would be incredibly proud as it turns 40. ""She was just one small person and I think her story deserves to be heard,"" said her friend Stella Gratrix, who was one of the charity's first trustees. ""She was a powerful force at 4ft 11."" Aged 23, Ginny set up her first riding centre in Coombe, Gloucestershire. Barbara Metcalfe met her for the first time when she took her then five-year-old daughter along to learn to ride. She said it was immediately clear Ginny was ""absolutely devoted to her horses"". ""She was somebody who cared deeply about the horses and not at all about the money she was going to make,"" she said. Barbara then began volunteering at the centre and a close friendship was formed. Ginny made a similar impression on Stella, who got to know her when she later moved to Wales in 1982 and set up in Trefenter in Ceredigion. ""Ginny survived on bread and potatoes one winter because all of her money went on to buy fodder for the horses, she was totally dedicated,"" she said. ""Her motto was 'every penny possible for the ponies'."" She also remembers Ginny for her strong language. ""A typical horsey lady,"" she laughed. When Ginny founded the charity in 1985, Stella, Barbara and Barbara's late husband Brian were made trustees. She wanted to create a refuge and safe haven for ponies and horses after being appalled by the condition and handling of wild hill ponies and foals she saw at local horse sales. ""We used to go to the horse sales with a camera and it was obviously known what we were doing and we'd have ice cold water chucked over us in February,"" said Stella. ""Ponies would be slipping and sliding because the floor wasn't clean,"" added Barbara. ""It was nothing really to see a foal, perhaps nervous after being taken from its mother, whacked across the back with a stick and then slip and slide all over the slippery floor."" The charity was formed and in her lifetime Ginny rescued 77 horses and helped many more. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992. Towards the end of her life she had a surprise reunion with 22 of the ponies she had rescued over the years, all of them happy, fit and thriving in their loan homes. She died at her home on 13 September 1994 following a stroke and is buried on the farm alongside her beloved pony Prince. Today the charity, which is still funded entirely by donations, has rescued more than 450 horses and ponies. It employs three full-time and two part-time grooms and welcomes volunteers throughout the year. A recent success story is Jack Sparrow, a foal who was rescued after being found alone in a drainage ditch along the sea wall in Peterstone, Newport, last July. He was the third orphan foal the charity took in during 2024 but sadly the only one to survive. Another success story is Connie. During the Covid pandemic in 2020, the charity received a call from a walker to say they had discovered a foal trying to feed from its dead mother close to the charity in Llangadog. Their team had to carry the foal over fences by torchlight before taking her back to the farm for an assessment by vets and feeding her replacement foal milk every two hours through the night. Today she is a happy, healthy five-year-old. Ginny was a keen writer, often writing about her life and work in notebooks or even on the back of envelopes. To coincide with the charity's 40th birthday, Stella and Barbara have collected and edited her handwritten stories. The result is a book - Ginny's story of the Lluest Horse and Pony Trust. Barbara and Stella, who both met Ginny when they were in their 30s and are now in their 70s, said she continued to impact their lives. ""I think she gave me a lot of confidence by doing what I did for her and the trust,"" said Barbara. ""It enriched my life and I've still got a huge respect for her and what she did."" ""Ditto,"" said Stella. ""I still walk up to her grave and say hello."" What would Ginny make of her legacy?

A PhD student from China, he had been studying at University College London (UCL) and was paying more than £4,000 a month in rent. Police found his bedroom had been equipped with hidden cameras and discovered a wardrobe stocked with alcohol, ecstasy and an industrial chemical that the human body turns into the ""date rape"" drug GHB. He had a pipette for carefully measuring doses of the dangerous liquid. But detectives also found 1,277 videos on his electronic devices. At least some were filmed by Zou showing him raping unconscious women. The footage had been filmed in both the UK and China. Police were able to charge him with multiple assaults on women in both countries - including the rapes of women who have never come forward and have never been identified. During his trial at Inner London Crown Court, jurors had to watch footage found on Zou's devices of nine of the rapes. Zou, now 28, claimed he had been sleeping with five different women a month and taking cocaine, ketamine, ecstasy and what he called ""liquid E"" - the ""date rape"" drug GHB. He admitted that having sex with unconscious women was one of his fantasies, but he claimed the women in the videos found on his phone and cameras were ""acting"" - helping, he claimed, to bring his rape fantasies to life in exchange for money and gifts. However, the jury ultimately decided he was a serial rapist who had been drugging young women and filming the attacks. Zou has now been found guilty of 11 rapes of 10 different women - two who have been identified and another eight who have yet to be traced - across two different continents. Detectives say they fear he may have raped as many as 50 more women. ""This man may well turn out to be one of the most prolific sexual predators that we've ever seen in this country,"" Commander Kevin Southworth, from the Metropolitan Police, told the BBC. Many of the women he raped were completely unconscious. One - who we are calling Ms L - said she woke up to find Zou raping her before she drifted back into unconsciousness. Another - who we are calling Ms N - only discovered Zou had secretly filmed himself raping her when detectives found the video in his flat, eight months after she had first reported him. ""I think he is a devious and Machiavellian individual,"" Commander Southworth told the BBC. He said Zou would meet women socially, or through social media, and then take them back to his flat where he would ply them with drink laced with drugs. ""He would commit those sexual assaults while they're incapacitated and possibly even while they're asleep and completely unaware,"" added Commander Southworth. Zou - who comes from Dongguan City, in southern China, close to Hong Kong - grew up in a wealthy family who owned several properties in China and were able afford the hefty fees for his higher education in the UK. His nickname was Pakho, the name some of the women he later raped knew him by. At the age of 20 he moved to Northern Ireland to finish the final two years of his mechanical engineering degree at Queen's University, Belfast (QUB). In September 2019, he then moved to London to study a Masters in mechanical engineering at UCL, but returned to China the following year during the Covid-19 pandemic. While there, in November 2020, he used an obscure messaging app to download what amounted to an instruction manual on how to drug and rape young women. One advert police found on his phone had the words ""effects guaranteed"" splashed across pictures of sleeping, naked women. On his telephone police also found seven videos of him raping women in China. They were referred to in court as Females B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Five of the women looked completely unconscious in the videos. One, Female G, appeared to wake briefly while Zou was raping her, but struggled to maintain consciousness. Female H could be heard snoring. Another woman, Female D, was unconscious when the rape began but came round and repeatedly told Zou ""please, no"", while trying to fight him off. The videos were so disturbing that the judge, Rosina Cottage KC, made sure the jurors watched them as little as possible. Detectives have not been able to track down the women in China. Although some of his victims were raped in China, Zou could be put on trial in the UK because he was resident here. Saira Pike, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was important to bring justice for the unknown females who Zou could be seen raping in videos. ""It was really important that we fight for them,"" she said. ""I was determined to go forward with that and not use the fact that we couldn't identify the females as a deterrent from getting justice for them."" But Zou did not only rape women in China. Two of the most distressing videos showed the rape of Female A at Zou's student accommodation in Bloomsbury, central London. Police have never been able to establish who Female A is, and it is unclear if she was raped before or after Zou's trip to China during the pandemic. At the start of the first video, Female A was seen to be unconscious, but woke and pleaded with Zou to stop. ""I hate you,"" she can be heard saying. ""It's pointless,"" Zou replied. ""The sound insulation here is very good."" The second video is similar. Both had been filmed on a tiny spy camera the size of a thumb, placed on a shelf on the other side of the room. When detectives first found the videos they could not extract the sound. At first Zou insisted the woman in the video was fully consenting to sex. But just before the trial, detectives managed to recover the sound, showing Female A was clearly under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and that she was begging him to stop. Zou then changed his story, telling the jury it was ""rape role play"" and the young woman had been acting. ""Zou is plainly a depraved and cowardly individual who's preyed on his victim survivors in the most despicable manner,"" Commander Southworth said. Police have never been able to trace Female A. However, two women did give evidence against Zou during the trial. Ms N, a young Chinese student, described how she first met Zou in May 2023. He had been helping her with maths. A few days later, they both went to a party at another flat in his luxury block, the UNCLE building, in Elephant and Castle. After the party, he persuaded her to go back to his flat where he plied her with drinks. The court heard Zou then dragged her into his bedroom where he raped her. Some of their conversation in the flat was recorded on a spy camera beside Zou's bed, which was triggered by a motion sensor. ""Finish the drink,"" Zou kept saying on the video. ""Finish the drink. It should not be wasted."" Ms N does not remember much after drinking the large glass of vodka. She reported the rape to the police soon afterwards, but unsure of the law, and she says discouraged by the officers' response - including a poor translation of her 999 call - she decided not to pursue the allegation. The Metropolitan Police have said it was regretful victims did not get the best translation. ""There is undoubtedly some learning from the first response that these victims received,"" Commander Southworth added. Eight months after Ms N first spoke to police, detectives contacted her again, telling her they had found the videos of Zou plying her with drink, and photographs on his phone showing her being raped. Ms N was so upset about her ordeal that she also posted on the Chinese social media app Red Note (Xiaohongshu) warning other women about Zou. This was spotted by another woman - Ms L - who replied and said she had had a similar experience. Ms L said she met Zou when she was 19, in August 2021. They had consensual sex a couple of times and had agreed to meet up with friends at a restaurant in London's Chinatown. The group moved onto a private room at another restaurant, drinking several bottles of Jack Daniel's. She has little memory of what happened after, but she ended up at Zou's Bloomsbury flat. ""When I woke up I found him on top of me having sex,"" she said. When they searched Zou's flat after his arrest, police found four spy cameras. The court heard they also found a yellow Fendi ""trophy box"" in the wardrobe containing jewellery and clothing which police think may have belonged to women he raped. Police have not found any phones, computers or cameras from his time in Belfast so they do not know if his campaign of drug rape had already begun while he was studying there. UCL said Zou was suspended on 27 January 2024 and he stopped studying there ""as soon we were informed about the allegations"". The university said its online portal was available for students and staff affected by the case and that it was supporting the police appeal. Zou was found guilty of 11 charges of raping 10 women, three counts of voyeurism, three counts of possessing a controlled drug with intent to rape, and one count of false imprisonment. The jury found him not guilty of charges of possessing MDMA, Ketamine and Xanax with intent to rape. They also found him not guilty of two charges of possessing extreme pornography depicting rape.",,,,'Depraved and cowardly' rapist may have attacked 50 more women,"Daniel Sandford, UK correspondent•@BBCDanielS, •",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The Royal Navy has released images of a Russian warship which it tracked sailing near British waters. The corvette Boikiy was part of a task group which was tracked by HMS Somerset for three days as it made its way through the English Channel and North Sea, escorting a merchant vessel on its return from Syria to Russia. Patrol aircraft and Nato forces also assisted with the monitoring operation, the navy said. Boikiy is one of several Russian vessels to have been tracked sailing near the British coast in recent months. The Royal Navy said its operation began on Saturday as the Russian warship headed south through the North Sea and English Channel to meet the merchant vessel, known as Baltic Leader, to escort it back to Russia. Somerset, a British Type 23 frigate, used its radar system to report on the movements and a Merlin helicopter from its naval air squadron was also launched to gather information from the sky. The Russian merchant ship was transporting military hardware from the Russian naval base in Tartus, Syria, with crew on the accompanying warship seen burning papers and manning the ship's machine guns, the Times reported. BBC Verify has analysed satellite imagery and found the Baltic Leader docked in Tartus on 1 February. At the time, its publicly-available tracker was turned off, according to ship tracking site MarineTraffic. It is not possible to see what is on the ship, but imagery shows a number of containers and other items on the dock nearby. According to shipping database Equasis, the owner of the Baltic Leader is Russian shipping company MG-Flot LLC - which was sanctioned by the UK government after being accused of helping Russia to destabilise Ukraine. In 2022, the vessel was also sanctioned by the US due to its links to Russian lender Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian entities targeted by the US and European countries in the aftermath of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",,,,Russian warship tracked near British waters,"Adam Hale, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A 28-year-old woman died after falling about 65ft from Tryfan mountain in Eryri National Park, an inquest has heard. Maria Rosanova Eftimova, a structural civil engineer, from St Helens, Merseyside, slipped while attempting to climb rocks with friends on 22 February. Coroner Kate Roberston stated that despite rescue crews and paramedics attending the scene, Ms Eftimova died before she could be taken to hospital. In a tribute, Victoria Critchley, said she was ""ambitious, bright and cherished, whose vibrant personality, energy and aura touched and uplifted all around her"". Tryfan is one of the highest mountains in Eryri National Park – and is often described as a peak that marks the line between hiking and mountaineering and is difficult to navigate in a traditional manner, especially in poor weather. With no marked footpaths to the summit, it requires using hands and scrambling skills to reach the top. It was used as a training ground to test oxygen equipment and safety techniques before the first ever successful climb of Everest in 1953. Chris Lloyd, chairman of Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, said people should ""check the weather forecast and make sure you are suitable equipped"" before venturing on the mountains. At the opening of the inquest in Caernarfon on Wednesday, Ms Robertson said Ms Eftimova had attempted to reach a ledge for a handhold to lift herself up, but her heel slipped, which caused her to fall a ""considerable distance"". A post mortem examination showed that Ms Eftimova, who is originally from Sofia, in Bulgaria, had suffered severe head injuries, including a fractured skull.",,,,Woman died climbing on mountain rocks - inquest,"Chris Dearden, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm. The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts. There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood. Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028. The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails. Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court. She said a cap on sitting days had a ""drastic effect"", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog. A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was ""unprecedented"", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem. ""The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,"" she told the Today programme. ""We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,"" she added. But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt ""out of reach"" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma. One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back. Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under ""immense pressure"" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever. ""With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,"" she said. ""I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first."" Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had ""accepted"" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented. The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",,,,More funding for judges to tackle record court delays,"Dominic Casciani, Home and Legal Correspondent•@BBCDomC, •, Adam Hale, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"A formal application for a fresh inquest into the deaths of 50 people in the 1973 Summerland fire disaster has been submitted to the Isle of Man's Attorney General. The Justice for Summerland Group, made up of survivors and relatives of victims, has previously called for the original misadventure verdicts to be overturned. Belfast-based human rights law firm Phoenix Law, representing the families, said it wanted to reopen the case to ""ensure a comprehensive investigation"" using ""modern legal and forensic standards"". The Isle of Man government said the Attorney General's Chambers can confirm that an application has been received and will be given appropriate consideration. About 3,000 people were at the Summerland entertainment complex, which at the time was one of the biggest indoor leisure complexes in Europe, when a blaze broke out on the evening of 2 August 1973, It was thought to have been started by three boys from Liverpool smoking. A public inquiry held in the aftermath found there were ""no villains"" and only human beings who made mistakes. However, making its application, Phoenix Law said there had been an ""irregularity of proceedings in the original inquest"" which had not commented on or addressed ""substantial issues"" including the cause of the fire. The firm said there was ""substantial fresh evidence which was not heard at the original inquest or commission which call into question the central conclusions"", suggesting the forensic analysis of the time was now ""unreliable"". A spokesman also said several experts had provided written support for a fresh investigation into the fire ""on the premise that there have been significant developments within the forensic science on how fires are investigated"". He said they had pointed to the Stardust Fire, in which 48 young people died in a fire in a north Dublin nightclub in 1981, where ""the cause of fire was established many years after the event"". The firm's Darragh Mackin, who last year represented many families affected in the Stardust fire, said the relatives of those killed at Summerland had ""raised concerns about the original investigation"" for years. It was ""difficult to envisage a more compelling set of circumstances to which point firmly in favour of a fresh investigation"", he added.

Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day. We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken. It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with ""keepsake packaging""). What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry. ""I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,"" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills. She makes different types of pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts. There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt. ""Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,"" Meghan explains. ""So I try to under salt."" Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business. It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design. It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains. Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides. It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life. Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. ""Love is in the detail, gang,"" she says. And ""it's time to pop a bottle"" for a glass of champagne. Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit. And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever.

,,,reliable,,"A new TV series featuring the Duchess of Sussex - With Love, Meghan - has started on Netflix. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the UK after stepping back from official royal duties in 2020. The couple has since launched various commercial ventures, including a new lifestyle brand headed by Meghan Markle called American Riviera Orchard. Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. They stepped down as senior royals in January 2020. Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their ""SussexRoyal"" brand. Harry remains a prince and is fifth in line to the throne. The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles. When Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Harry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021. In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK. The couple no longer has an official UK residence. In early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate. The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundation has repeatedly raised questions about Harry's US immigration status because of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. It wants the government to release his records, to show whether drug use was disclosed - as this can block US visa applications. But in September 2024, US judge Carl Nichols ruled Prince Harry's visa application should remain private. At the time, some reports had suggested the prince wanted to return to the UK. However, BBC News royal correspondent Sean Coughlan said sources had confirmed Prince Harry would continue to be based in the US, partly because of continuing concerns about his family's security arrangements. In December 2024, the prince said his life in the US was what his mother would have ""wanted"" for him. Prince Harry has returned to the UK several times during his various court cases against newspaper publishers. He made a rare public appearance in London in September 2024 for the WellChild awards, celebrating the bravery of children and young people with serious illness or disability. But before that, he had not been in the UK since attending a memorial service for his uncle Lord Robert Fellowes in Norfolk in August 2024. The Prince of Wales was also there, although the brothers reportedly did not speak to each other. In May 2024, Harry attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the sporting competition for injured servicemen and women which he helped found. He did not see his father Charles or his brother William during the visit. In February 2024, he flew back for a 45-minute meeting with Charles after Buckingham Palace announced that the King was being treated for cancer. Harry attended the King's coronation in May 2023 without Meghan. The duke and duchess both came back to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September of that year. As working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant made up the other 5%. When they stepped down as senior royals, King Charles gave them ""a substantial sum"" to help establish their new life. Harry and Meghan set up the Archewell charitable foundation, and entered into a number of commercial arrangements with private companies. In February 2024 the couple launched their Sussex.com website, which said they were ""shaping the future through business and philanthropy"". American Riviera Orchard In March 2024, Meghan launched what appeared to be a new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard. Little is known about the new venture, but in April 2024, pictures of branded jam jars circulated on social media, suggesting it may sell food products. Television The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, makes programmes for the Netflix streaming service under a deal thought to be worth millions of dollars. In April 2024, Archewell said two new series were in production, one celebrating ""the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship"", and another exploring the world of professional polo. Polo was broadcast in December 2024. With Love, Meghan - which Netflix described as a lifestyle show blending ""practical how tos and candid conversation"" - began on 4 March. The couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional ""unravelling"" after military service in Afghanistan. Podcasts Archewell also made podcasts for Spotify under a contract thought to be worth $25m (£19.7m). This included a series called Archetypes, which featured the duchess in conversation with other well known women. The arrangement ended in June 2023. In February 2024, Meghan announced a new podcast deal with Lemonada Media, with the first programme expected later in 2025. Books Harry's memoir, Spare, was published in January 2023. It discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his grief over the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The book's publishers promised $1.5m (£1.18m) and £300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities. Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021. Inheritance William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's £13m fortune when she died in 1997. In a 2021 interview, Harry told Oprah Winfrey this money funded his family's move to the US. He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It is not known whether Queen Elizabeth left him any money. Acting During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits. She appeared in more than 100 episodes. After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals. When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection, and took the government to court. Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly funded police security in the UK, under ""bespoke arrangements"". In late February 2024, the High Court ruled that this approach ""was, and is, legally sound"". In June, Harry's legal team said he had been given permission to challenge the High Court decision in the Court of Appeal. An earlier separate court ruling rejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection. In January 2025, Prince Harry settled a case with News Group Newspapers (NGN), after it offered a ""full and unequivocal apology"" for ""serious intrusion"" into his private life between 1996 and 2011, and ""incidents of unlawful activity"" by private investigators. It agreed to pay him an undisclosed amount of damages. NGN owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times and published the News of the World before its 2011 closure.

,,,reliable,,"On the day police found a second body behind a house once occupied by a murderer, the father of a missing teenager raised his hand, crossed his fingers and said he hoped it was his daughter. Dinah McNicol was 18 when she vanished in 1991, after hitchhiking home to Essex from a dance music festival in Hampshire. Her father had spoken to countless reporters since then and it just so happened that I was interviewing him when 16 years of tortuous uncertainty were coming to an end. Ian McNicol had been left in such a dark place that he wanted his daughter to be the person in a shallow grave, because it would mean the family would finally know where she was, get her back, and lay her to rest. His words laid bare the terrible cruelty of serial killers and they've haunted me ever since. A new BBC documentary, The Hunt for Peter Tobin, explains how the murder of a young Polish student finally solved the mystery of what had happened to Dinah and a second teenager, 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton, who had gone missing in central Scotland six months earlier in February 1991. Tobin was a registered sex offender on the run from the authorities when he killed Angelika Kluk and concealed her body beneath the floor of a Glasgow church in September 2006. He was 60 at the time. The crime was so horrific, detectives were convinced he must have killed before. Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram, a nationwide scoping exercise which tried to establish whether Tobin could be linked to unsolved cases around the UK. Within months, officers realised he was living in Bathgate when Vicky Hamilton went missing in the West Lothian town. Despite a huge inquiry and appeals by her distraught family, 15 years had passed with no trace of Vicky ever being found. The link with Tobin changed everything. Forensic scientists re-examined evidence from the time of her disappearance and found DNA from Tobin's son on Vicky's purse, which had been left near Edinburgh bus station. In June 2007, Lothian and Borders Police searched Tobin's former home in Bathgate. In the attic, they discovered a knife which bore traces of Vicky's DNA. Operation Anagram went on to connect Tobin to Dinah, who'd gone missing at the other end of the country in August 1991. Her cash card had been used in towns across the south-east of England, from Hove to Margate and Ramsgate in Kent. The money draining from Dinah's account was compensation she received after her mother Judy died in a road accident when she was six. The police found evidence linking Tobin to the card and established he was living in Margate when Dinah failed to come home. One of Tobin's neighbours recalled ""Scottish Pete"" digging a deep hole in his back garden around that time. Essex Police thought they were going to get answers for Ian McNicol and his family when they went to Tobin's old house at 50 Irvine Drive in November 2007 - but instead of Dinah, they found Vicky. Having covered the search in Bathgate, I travelled south to Margate with a sense of disbelief which was shared by the Scottish officers investigating Tobin's past. Everyone in Scotland knew the face of the smiling schoolgirl with the bobbed dark hair. The discovery of her remains so far from home was horrifying and baffling. How had she ended up there? The answer was that Tobin had killed Vicky in Bathgate, dismembered her body, and taken her remains with him when he moved to a new house 470 miles away in the south of England. In the days that followed, as the police continued their search for Dinah at Irvine Drive, I interviewed her dad at his home in Tillingham, a small Essex village built round a Norman church. Ian was an instantly likeable man in his late 60s; a retired musician originally from Glasgow who'd named his daughter after a jazz standard. Over the years, Dinah's disappearance had taken its toll on his health. We sat down and started filming. ""When I lost my wife, we knew she was dead because we had to bury her,"" he said. ""We went through the normal process of grief. ""When a member of your family goes missing, it's 20 times worse than death because you do not know a thing and all sorts of things go through your imagination.""

Now working in East Kent, she is one of more than 50,000 NHS staff in the wider South East who self-reported as not being British in 2023, many of whom may have come to the UK as migrants. Ms Belete said ""learning the language and learning the culture was the hardest thing"" about integrating in the UK. Across Kent Sussex and Surrey approximately 25% of NHS staff are from overseas, but the region still struggles with a vacancy rate of more than 8%. NHS trusts all recruit from overseas to try and fill the gaps they have in their workforce with many describing overseas staff as ""vital"" to be able to maintain services. Having left Sudan almost a decade ago, Ms Belete travelled to the UK via Libya and then across the Mediterranean sea. She said some people could not accept that she had arrived in the UK illegally. Ms Belete said it was ""kind of alarming to people to think that I'm a criminal person"". Supported by the Kent Refugee Action Network, Ms Belete was fostered in Kent as an unaccompanied minor and said she watched Emmerdale and Eastenders on TV to help her learn English. It was always her dream to work in the health service. ""Healthcare, that was really something I was really passionate about,"" she said.

,,,reliable,,"The Post Office is being removed from one of the schemes set up to compensate victims of the Horizon IT scandal. The government will now take over responsibility for the Overturned Convictions Scheme, which provides redress for those who have had their convictions quashed In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal. It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people. More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated. We've broken down how they work. There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case. The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections. Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama. While the cohort secured a £42.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it. The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government. As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme ""will receive at least £75,000 in compensation upfront"". The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them. On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days. As of 31 January, £128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments. Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned. If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme. There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme. People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office. A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible. Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked £600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more. All eligible people are entitled to an ""interim"" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments. For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme. This will entitle them to an initial £200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept £600,000 or have their case fully reviewed. As of 31 January, £65m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments. The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out. A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd. The Post Office scandal goes far beyond the original GLO court case and the people who wound up with criminal convictions. Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme. In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action. It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma. It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well. It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data from the Department for Business and Trade. Around £315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025. The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward. It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years. On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",,,,How do the Post Office scandal compensation schemes work?,No author available,,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King. Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy. He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting. Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an ""unprecedented"" sign of friendship and respect. Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country. It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US. It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations. The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia. With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky. Trump described the King as a ""beautiful man"", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government. The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral. For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the ""indescribable aggression"" against Ukraine, in what he called an ""unprovoked attack on their land"". Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values. He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel. But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation. ""Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,"" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting. Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians. They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president. Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the ""special relationship"" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada. The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump. ""I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,"" emailed Peggy. ""I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,"" Ann said in an email to the newsletter. ‌It won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK. It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion. And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.

Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the agreement would come into force on 24 March, after the return of the Ben-my-Chree from dry dock. The Steam Packet said the vessel would undergo port trials and pilotage training before entering service. Danish ferry operator DFDS confirmed the MV Arrow would act as the firm's main freight vessel for the Jersey to Portsmouth route from 28 March. Currently based in Douglas, the MV Arrow can carry 66 14m (46ft) trailers and accommodate 12 passengers. It was bought by the Steam Packet for about £8m in 2022 as a back-up freight vessel for the island's then flagship ferry, the Ben-my-Chree. While it has remained an option for the firm since the arrival of the Manxman in July 2023, under the company's sea services agreement with the Manx government the former flagship ferry must be retained for back-up passenger and freight services. Jersey's government signed a contract with DFDS to operate ferry services in the Channel Islands in December. On March 28 the Danish firm is set to take over the contract from previous provider Condor Ferries, which had also used the MV Arrow to increase freight capacity. It will travel to Teeside for its own dry-docking before its charter with DFDS following the return of the Ben-my-Chree to Manx waters next month.

,,,reliable,,"The government has announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at sea. Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024. The number of people claiming asylum in the UK during the year to December 2024 was the highest since records began, in 1979. As at 26 February 2,056 people had crossed the Channel since the start of 2025. In 2024 as a whole, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. The highest figures were for 2022, when 45,755 people arrived. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than 23,000 did so after Labour won the July 2024 general election. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists. Suspects face travel bans, social-media blackouts and phone restrictions. A new offence of endangering lives at sea will carry a jail term of up to five years. And those convicted of acts in preparation for smuggling - such as buying boat parts - will face up to 14 years in prison. Separately, the government has issued guidance saying anyone entering the UK by an irregular route - such as a small boat crossing - will normally be refused citizenship. Previously, refugees who entered this way could apply for citizenship after 10 years. The Refugee Council estimates at least 71,000 people will be affected. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency, tracks the number of people who die attempting to cross the Channel. The IOM estimates that at least 78 migrants died in 2024, making it the deadliest year on record. It says that at least 225 migrants have lost their lives attempting to cross since 2018. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, with more people crammed into less seaworthy boats. According to the latest Home Office figures, Afghans were the top nationality arriving by small boat in 2024. Syrians made up the second largest group, followed by people from Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea. These five nationalities accounted for 61% of all small-boat arrivals. Albanians were the top nationality detected arriving by small boat in 2022, with 12,658 arrivals, but only 616 people came from the country in 2024. More than 108,130 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending December 2024, the Home Office figures show, the highest number since records began, in 1979, an increase of 18% compared with 2023, and almost twice the number in 2021. The previous peak, of 103,000 was recorded in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims fell sharply after 2002, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. But numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria, and have risen again recently, after an increase in recorded small-boat arrivals. And in 2024, almost one out of every three (32%) of those claiming asylum arrived via this route. In the year to December 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 10,500 applications. A quarter of all applications came from people from Pakistan, Afghanistan (8,508) and Iran (8,099), Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As at 17 December 2024, 267,200 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are also separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. The Home Office figures show 91% of the 7,800 refugees resettled in the UK in 2024 arrived through the Afghan Resettlement Programme. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of December 2024, 90,686 cases relating to 124,802 people were awaiting an initial decision. That is 5% fewer than were waiting at the end of 2023 - but the the number of outstanding cases is still higher than before 2022. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. But 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year and 1,428 remained unresolved at the end of December 2024. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. In the year to the end of December 2024,8,200 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country, an increase of 28% from 2023. Albanians were the most common nationality for enforced returns in 2024 - 84%, compared with 87% of all returns in 2023. Between 2018 and December 2024, 4,995 people who came to the UK in small boats were returned - about 3% of the total small-boat arrivals during the period. There were more than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe during 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers. In 2023, there were 263,000 arrivals by sea in Europe. In the year ending September 2024, 1.11 million people claimed asylum in the European Union and European Economic Area, down 3% compared with the previous year. Germany received the most applicants, 294,415 - more than a quarter of the total.

,,,reliable,,"The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show. According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021. The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002. The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022. The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the ""EU plus"" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog. These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024. The number remains higher than before 2022. The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%. Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023. There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024. The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were ""no quick fixes"" to the ""global"" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a ""serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system"". Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a ""broken asylum system"", saying Labour inherited a ""huge backlog"" of claims. ""We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again."" Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said ""many people want to come here"", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum. She underlined ""we have to be much tougher"" dealing with visa overstayers. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as ""no surprise,"" saying there was ""no deterrent"". Philp added that the blame for the numbers ""lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border"". The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create ""more safe routes"" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK. ""Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option,"" Bhutta said in a statement. ""For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here."" New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship. The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs. The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was ""encouraged"" the government continued to work on the ""broken asylum system"" during its first six months in power. However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people ""stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work"". The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023. The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament. The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation. While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped. The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes – including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa. The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK. The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000. This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000). Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route. The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas. But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year. In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers. A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration. Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, referred to a ""boom and bust"" in some visa categories over recent years. ""The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,"" he said. ""Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels.""",,,,UK asylum claims hit highest level since 1979,"Cachella Smith and Tom Symonds, BBC News, Rob England, BBC Verify",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"The Church of England says it is initiating disciplinary proceedings against 10 members of clergy following a review of evidence in the report into the prolific abuser, John Smyth. Among those facing action are former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and Rev Andrew Cornes - who was due to be on the committee picking the next Archbishop of Canterbury. Smyth, who died in 2018, used horrific violence to attack boys at his Winchester home in the 1970s and 1980s, the Makin Review into his abuse found. Justin Welby, who stepped down as Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year because of the scandal, is among several senior figures not facing action because of ""insufficient evidence"" for disciplinary proceedings. Also not facing action but coming under criticism in the Makin Review are four serving bishops - the current Bishop of Lincoln Stephen Conway, Bishop of Episcopal Ministry in the Anglican Communion Jo Bailey Wells, Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Martin Seeley and the Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba. A survivor of Smyth's abuse told the BBC he was relieved that some were ""at long last"" being held to account for their failings but said he was surprised others had not been named. The long-awaited report was released in November and detailed ""the prolific, brutal and horrific"" abuse perpetrated against more than 120 boys and young men by Smyth at Christian camps from the late 1970s in England until his death in South Africa in 2018. That review led to the resignation of Justin Welby for what he acknowledged was his ""personal and institutional responsibility"". The Church's National Safeguarding Team has since reviewed the evidence against nearly 40 other active clergy criticised in the report, deciding that some of it meets the threshold for further action. Those who are facing disciplinary proceedings by the Church of England are accused in the report of various degrees of failing to act during the timeline of Smyth's abuse. The report said former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey had been informed of the abuse in an outline of a report in 1983 which ""contained enough information about abuses to signal a need for action regarding John Smyth"". Lord Carey denied seeing it and told the review he did not know Smyth when he studied at Trinity Theological College when Lord Carey was principal. Makin said that ""seems highly unlikely"" given Smyth's public prominence at the time. He gave up his ""permission to officiate"" in December following a BBC investigation into the Church of England's handling of a separate sexual abuse case. Another priest that now faces disciplinary action is Canon Andrew Cornes, a retired clergyman from the Chichester diocese who was due to be a member of the Crown Nominations Commission that will appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury. The Makin review said Rev Cornes was told in 1982 by a victim of Smyth about abuse he suffered. It said there was ""no evidence to suggest that Andrew Cornes took action to respond to this, he suggests that he thought that the matter was being dealt with"". The Church of England has clarified that Rev Cornes has ""voluntary stepped back from ministry pending the outcome of this process and will not be participating in the Crown Nominations Commission"".",,,,Ten Church of England clergy face disciplinary action,"Aleem Maqbool, Religion editor, Steve Swann, BBC News",,,,,,,1

Ryan Castellucci previously lost a High Court challenge to have their gender recorded as non-binary on a gender recognition certificate - a document which changes someone's legal sex - after moving to the UK in 2019. They had obtained legal recognition as non-binary in California in 2021, and were issued an American passport in 2022 listing their sex as 'X'. Dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Singh said the issue was ""potentially controversial"" and was ""better suited to resolution in Parliament than the courts"". At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Castellucci, a cyber security expert who moved to the UK from California, uses the title ""Mx"" and refers to themselves using they/them pronouns. While they have undergone surgery and hormone treatment, they told the court they continue to use the name Ryan as it is considered unisex in the US. Castellucci described the experience of trying to obtain legal documents listing them as non-binary as an ""ordeal"" and the court heard they worried about possible difficulties related to their gender identity when applying for British citizenship. They also raised concerns about how their gender identity would be reflected on their death certificate, when their US documents state they are non-binary. Lord Justice Singh, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Sir Andrew McFarlane, said that only 11 countries worldwide, as well as some US states including California, recognise non-binary gender in law.

,,,reliable,,"Stonewall has said it is trying to ""meet the challenges of this new political era"" after it was reported the LGBTQ+ charity could be forced to cut up to half of its staff in the wake of US President Donald Trump's overseas aid freeze. The charity told the BBC ""an organisation-wide consultation"" has begun and said that ""hard-won rights are being rolled back for marginalised communities across the world"". Only roles with dedicated funding would be safe, Stonewall's CEO Simon Blake told staff in a call on Thursday. When asked by the BBC how much foreign aid spending cuts related to their decision, Stonewall said there are ""a number of reasons for the consultation"". Stonewall has 114 employees, according to the UK charity commission website. The charity's largest funder in recent years has been the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which is overseen by the US state department. It has given Stonewall more than £500,000 between 2021 and 2025. Stonewall's accounts show the GEF granted it £137,254 in 2021-22, £204,442 in 2022-23 and £233,583 in 2023-24. The GEF is a pooled fund from several countries and private business, with a focus on ""advancing LGBTI rights around the world"". But, according to the Times, it has not published accounts since 2015. President Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought in line with his ""America First"" strategy. The US government has announced a freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a ""review"" to ensure they align with Trump's priorities. Mr Blake warned about the impact that Trump's policies would have on Stonewall and LGBTQ+ rights globally. ""The work to advocate for LGBTQ+ equality has never been more important and Stonewall is rising to meet the challenge,"" Stonewall said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are seeing an unprecedented political backlash against the principles of inclusion. Stonewall is adapting to ensure that it is fit for purpose and able to meet the challenges of this new political era.""

,,,reliable,,"The government has agreed to relax budgeting rules for a record 29 English councils to allow them to balance their books next year. The authorities will be allowed to use Treasury loans or cash from selling assets to cover day-to-day spending, which they are normally banned from doing. The figure is up from 19 that requested such flexibility this year, further underscoring the continued financial fragility of the sector. Ministers will, however, encourage councils not to sell off ""community and heritage assets"" to help meet current spending pressures. It remains to be seen what this means in practice, with the government leaving it to authorities to decide which assets meet this definition. Councils in England will have £69.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year. But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years. On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective £1.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic. Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions. They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year. Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton. Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022. The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs. Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online. They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment. The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in ""partnership - not punishment"". The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending. London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a ""short-term measure"" that ""leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about"". The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing. Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing. They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally.

,,,reliable,,"Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found. Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012. In its report the organisation said there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders. A government spokesperson called the findings ""extremely concerning"" and said it would ""seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs"". A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group. The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago. The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace. For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said. Tell Mama said that shift reflected ""the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities"". Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter. Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK. Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders.

,,,reliable,,"Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said. The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity. ""On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office,"" Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding ""no checks"" had been made. It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade. Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022. A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim. He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks. It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months. As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police. The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with £1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created. Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was ""better than nothing"", adding there needed to be more accountability for ""people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked"".

Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post. The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title. If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March.

Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer, Scotland, a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries. The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, had been found alternative accommodation, the force said. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne.

,,,reliable,,"Successive governments trying to look ""tough on crime"" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests. The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending. The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were ""knee-jerk"" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action. Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026. ""It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,"" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report. Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high. The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding. It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring. The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built.",,,,"'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review","Dominic Casciani, Home and Legal Correspondent•@BBCDomC, •",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have revealed their artistic skills in four portraits of each other. It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis. The royals drew the portraits as ""a moment of connection"" to ""spend time looking at and focusing on one another"" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added. The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us. The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions. The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis. Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university. Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day. These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account. A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte. The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte. The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings. The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills. ""These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us,"" said the message on social media, alongside the pictures. ""Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative,"" the post continued.

The airline is set to reduce flights between Ronaldsway Airport and Liverpool and Manchester between April and November following a fall in demand.

This is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before. He says he's been ""abused"" and ""physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house"". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear. Ben bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after. As well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night.

Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job.""

,,,reliable,,"Landlords for social housing in England will have to fix damp and mouldy properties more quickly from October, the government has announced. The rules will eventually cover private landlords as well. Campaigners called for stricter rules after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died because of mould at his Rochdale home in 2020. Mould - sometimes referred to by the American spelling mold - is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places. Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma. Inhaling or touching the spores that mould releases into the air can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and a skin rash. Mould can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. The NHS in England spends an estimated £1.4bn every year treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to a 2021 report from building research body BRE. Those more at risk from mould include the elderly, children and babies, as well as people with existing respiratory illnesses and some skin problems. Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK. It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels, such as bathrooms and kitchens. When air cools, water vapour forms into water droplets as it comes into contact with cold surfaces. These surfaces can include uninsulated external walls or windows. If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow. Older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this. Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture such as showering, cooking and drying washing indoors. Taking shorter showers and wiping down surfaces afterwards can help, as can improving ventilation and opening windows or using an extractor fan when cooking. It is also important to check for leaky pipes or gutters which can make the problem worse. In December 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home. He lived in a one-bedroom flat in Rochdale with his father Faisal Abdullah and Faisal's wife Aisha Amin. Mr Abdullah reported the mould to his housing association, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), in 2017, but was told to paint over it. Awaab was taken to Rochdale Urgent Care Centre on 19 December that year with shortness of breath, and died a few days later. All landlords - private and social - already have a duty to keep their homes fit for human habitation. But after Awaab Ishak's death, campaigners called for stricter measures. Awaab's law was first passed in July 2023 under the previous Conservative government, but had not taken effect by the time of the 2024 general election. Labour has said that from October 2025, the rules will apply to social landlords - generally local councils or housing associations. These landlords will have to address damp and mould hazards that pose a significant risk of harm to tenants, within fixed timescales. From the same point, they will also have to address all emergency repairs - whether related to damp and mould or not - within 24 hours. New rules setting a timeframe for dealing with non-emergency repairs such as excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical faults and hygiene issues will take effect in 2026. More hazards will be added in 2027. Landlords who fail to act can be taken to court and ordered to pay compensation. The Housing charity Shelter criticised the government's decision to phase in the new legislation. It said it leaves social housing tenants at risk from poor quality accommodation. The government's Renters' Rights Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will extend the new rules to cover private landlords. Ministers previously said they hoped the bill would be passed by summer 2025.",,,,Black mould: How dangerous is it in the home and how can it be treated?,No author available,,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Spies lie, but they are not meant to get caught. On a wet Friday evening in December, three MI5 lawyers sat in a room at the BBC's headquarters in London. On the other side of the table were the BBC's lawyers and me. No MI5 officers were present, after we refused a request for the meeting to be secret. After exchanging strained smiles, we got down to business - and proved to them that the Security Service had been giving false evidence to the courts. The meeting took place after I told MI5 in November that we were planning to report it had lied and offered it a chance to comment. In response, the Security Service insisted - aggressively so - that it had been entirely honest. What it hadn't realised until the December meeting, was that I had hard evidence to prove its position was false. The revelation of the false evidence matters because it raises serious concerns about how reliable MI5's evidence is in the courts, where assessments from the Security Service are given enormous deference. It also raises fresh doubts about whether MI5 can continue with a core policy of secrecy - after we revealed it was applying it selectively. The organisation's first lie came when the government took the BBC to the High Court in 2022 to block a story about a right-wing extremist working as an MI5 agent - the term for a paid and authorised informant. Former Attorney General Suella Braverman failed to prevent us publishing the story but succeeded in getting an order preventing the man from being identified, having argued he would be in danger. As a result, the man is known publicly only as X. We argued he should be identified so women could be warned about such a predatory and violent man. X had used his MI5 role to coercively control his ex-partner, known publicly by the alias Beth. He was physically and sexually abusive, and was filmed threatening to kill her and then attacking her with a machete. During the legal proceedings, MI5 said it could publicly neither confirm nor deny (NCND) whether X was an agent, in line with its long-standing policy. In public, MI5 emphasises the fundamental role of the NCND policy, which it says it follows in relation to its agents. Any exceptions are said to undermine the secrecy that protects such men and women and to damage national security. But then, during the proceedings, a senior MI5 officer - a deputy director of the organisation and senior counter-terrorism officer, known in court as Witness A - mentioned some phone calls involving me. In a corporate witness statement, Witness A said an MI5 representative had spoken to me at an earlier date. This came after the Security Service became aware the BBC intended to include X in an investigative story. Witness A said that, during the discussions, I said I had suspected X was a state agent, but that MI5 had ""neither confirmed nor denied"" whether this was the case. He did not explain who initiated the discussions - it was MI5. Nor did he say how the Security Service had become aware of the planned BBC story - X had told them. In my own detailed witness statement, I said this account did not correspond with my recollection in various respects. I did not go into further detail, because - without any waiver of legal privilege - I had been advised by lawyers it would not affect the key issues in the dispute, which centred on the claimed risks to X if he were identified by the BBC. The BBC team also only had access to parts of the case - some evidence and hearings were in secret. During one secret part of the proceedings, to which the BBC team and I did not have access, security-cleared lawyers appointed on our behalf were also told by MI5's lawyers that it had maintained its neither confirm nor deny policy in the calls with me. But I knew that what Witness A said about me in his statement was untrue. I knew that MI5 had not abided by NCND. To be honest, I resented its lie. We can also now report that MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC director general Tim Davie, in December 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's planned story about X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, which were served as part of the government's evidence in the 2022 High Court case, record him claiming the intended story was ""inaccurate as well as reckless"". However, the story was accurate. The judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements were true and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. Despite not being allowed to identify X, the High Court ruled we could report the results of our investigation. It showed that X had abused Beth and another former partner, and that he was a dangerous extremist. At about the same time, Beth lodged a formal complaint about her treatment by MI5 with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), an independent court with the power to investigate human rights claims against the Security Service. It was at this court where MI5 would lie again. The IPT often sits in secret without claimants, their legal representatives, journalists or the public present, to consider evidence deemed sensitive for national security reasons. In the case of X, this meant all the information which confirmed he was an MI5 agent. Lawyers for the IPT are meant to represent the interests of claimants in the closed sessions. But Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, who is representing Beth, says the system is inherently problematic. ""You're not entitled to know what's being said about you. There might be things that are being said that you could disprove. You might be being called a liar and you're not entitled to know any of this,"" she says. All Beth would be able to know at the end of the case is whether she had won or lost, and she would never really understand why, Ms Ellis says. Beth asked the tribunal that MI5 drop its policy of neither confirming nor denying. Otherwise, her lawyers argued, most of the case would have to be heard in closed sessions. They said X had already disclosed his role to Beth and used it to coerce her. But lawyers for MI5 argued it would mean the Security Service being forced for the ""first time ever"" to confirm to a third party in legal proceedings whether someone was an agent. Last summer, the IPT ruled against Beth. While it accepted that maintaining NCND had an impact on her right to a fair hearing - because she cannot counter evidence presented in secret - it said the policy ""fundamentally relies upon the absolute consistency of its application"". It added that MI5 had ""gone to extensive lengths throughout these and the BBC proceedings to uphold the NCND policy"". MI5 repeated its false evidence to a third court when Beth sought a judicial review of this IPT ruling. From then, I was determined that the truth about MI5's behaviour had to come out. I had first met Beth when she was very unwell in the aftermath of X's abuse and coercion. I knew how far she had come since then and wanted to do right by her. I began working with a small team of BBC lawyers to develop a strategy. The truth is that, in several calls with me, a senior MI5 officer had departed from the NCND policy by announcing to me that X was an agent and inviting me to meet him. The officer said he had been legally authorised to tell me the information. The calls were part of MI5's attempt to persuade me not to identify X as an extremist as part of our planned investigative story. They came after I had sent X a letter, detailing his involvement in violent extremism and giving him an opportunity to respond. In November last year, after working with the BBC legal team for several months, I wrote to MI5 to say we planned to report that the Security Service had lied to the courts, and that it had departed from NCND during phone calls with me. I did not say how I would prove these claims. At the same time, the BBC lawyers wrote to the office of the new Attorney General, Lord Hermer, to tell them we planned to apply to the court to make public the part of the MI5 witness statement in which false evidence was given. On 25 November, a government lawyer responded on behalf of MI5 to me, saying that MI5 ""stands by the entirety of the account given to the High Court in Witness A's witness statement"". It said that the Security Service's position remains that ""there was no such departure"" from the NCND policy and suggested that MI5's evidence had been ""carefully considered"". I was surprised by this response. MI5 was gambling that I could not prove what I had set out. It was a gamble the Security Service was about to lose. We responded saying that MI5 was invited to a meeting where it could inspect the evidence we would rely on in our court application. We took this unusual step to allow MI5 to consider whether to consent to changing the terms of an injunction put in place at the end of the case against us in 2022. And so it came to that meeting on 13 December, when the three lawyers acting for MI5 came to the BBC's offices at London Broadcasting House to meet me and the BBC legal team. They read and listened to the relevant material, which comprised a handwritten note of a first call from MI5, an email I had sent to the MI5 officer following that call, and an audio recording of a second call the next day. I took the MI5 team through the evidence in chronological order. My impression was that they appeared slightly buoyed when shown a handwritten note, deflated by the email, and defeated when faced with the 40-minute audio recording - as each step revealed our evidence was stronger. My handwritten note showed what the purpose of MI5's call was - to tell me that X was an agent. The MI5 officer who rang me said he had been ""authorised"" to tell me, something which he said would otherwise have been ""illegal"". This information was volunteered to me by MI5, not in response to a query by me about whether X was an agent - which was not something I had asked either to X or to MI5. I had never spoken to the MI5 officer before. He was not a source or a friend. In fact, as I would find, he was seeking to protect X and gave a false impression about the man's risk to women. The officer, who worked closely with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum, characterised X as someone who was informing on extremists for the Security Service, not an extremist himself. The phone request was that we should not go ahead with our proposed story because MI5 said it was untrue. My impression was that MI5 had called assuming I would agree to this request with little further challenge. Instead, during the conversation I took issue with MI5's characterisation of X, whom I regarded - and still regard - as a genuine extremist. I also raised with MI5 the violence, abuse and coercion that X had engaged in within his personal life. I did not say how I knew about these matters, nor name anyone affected by them. Those matters had not been in my letter to X and I think the MI5 officer was surprised when I raised them. I made clear how concerned I was about these matters. I was troubled MI5 was seeking to protect someone I regarded as a danger to women, children and the wider public. The call concluded with me saying I would need to consider what he had requested, including in internal editorial discussions. The MI5 officer told me he was going to make checks based on concerns I had raised about X. He asked that I send him an email summarising the information about the man's personal conduct which I had mentioned during the phone call.",,,,How I exposed MI5's lie about its violent abusive agent,"Daniel De Simone, BBC investigations correspondent",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"People affected by leprosy in Nigeria should be able to get hold of vital drugs to treat the disease for the first time in a year from this weekend, the World Health Organization has said. The country, which reports more than 2,000 new cases a year ran out of supplies partly because drugs were held up after new regulations were introduced. The WHO said it had asked Nigeria to briefly lift its new testing policy and it expects the drugs to arrive from India on Sunday. Leprosy is curable with a combination of different antibiotics, but if left untreated the patients' health can deteriorate with sores and nerve damage that cause deformities. The treatment can last between six and 12 months. But because of the lack of drugs in Nigeria, patients have been sent home from hospitals. As the drugs suppress transmission this increases the risk of the disease spreading. Dr Samimu Msheliza, a public health expert and medical advisor at the Nigerian branch of the Leprosy Mission, highlighted the urgent need for medication. ""We have thousands of newly diagnosed leprosy patients across various cities who are just waiting for this drug,"" he told the BBC. ""The quicker we have [the drugs], the better, because currently these people are suffering, their transmission is ongoing because they are not being treated,"" Dr Msheliza said. The Reuters news agency spoke to one woman at a hospital in Nasarawa state, who said her condition had got much worse since she was not able to get hold of the combination of drugs. All Awwal Musa's fingers were clawed and her legs discharged pus. ""Before last year, my wounds were getting healed but now they are getting worse. The pain is worse,"" Ms Musa is quoted as saying. The nerve damage may be irreversible. Nigeria's drug authority introduced new regulations for medicines aimed at tackling the importation of counterfeit and sub-standard drugs. In recent years, several medicines have been recalled for failing to meet safety standards.

,,,reliable,,"Several people have died in South Sudan after an attempt by the UN to evacuate members of the national army came under fire, the UN has said. One crew member died when a UN helicopter was shot at, a statement from its mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, said. It added that an injured South Sudanese general and several other troops were also killed during the evacuation attempt in Upper Nile state. The UN said the attack on its helicopter ""may constitute a war crime"". South Sudan President Salva Kiir later said a second helicopter managed to take off after the attack, only to crash land, killing all on board. But Unmiss has said that both its aircraft landed safely in Malakal. Twenty-seven South Sudanese soldiers were killed in total, Information Minister Michael Makuei is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. Weeks of fighting in Upper Nile has threatened an already fragile peace deal between President Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar. In 2013, a rift between the pair sparked a five-year civil war, during which 400,000 people were killed and 2.5 million forced from their homes. A peace agreement was signed in 2018 but the situation has been fraught ever since. The ongoing fighting in Upper Nile is between the armed forces and the White Army, an ethnic militia that was allied with Machar during the war. In agreement with the White Army and South Sudan's army, Unmiss has been evacuating wounded troops from the conflict zone. Unmiss head Nicholas Haysom said in a statement that the attack on his mission's personnel was ""utterly abhorrent and may constitute a war crime under international law. We deeply regret the tragic loss of our colleague and express our sincere condolences to his loved ones. ""We also regret the killing of those that we were attempting to extract, particularly when assurances of safe passage had been received."" President Kiir said the army general who died in the attack was Gen Majur Dak, who led the forces stationed in Nasir, a region in Upper Nile. Alongside the fighting, a slew of arrests has sparked concerns that South Sudan may see a return to war. A number of Machar's allies, including the oil minister and a high-ranking army general, were detained earlier this week. After Friday's attack, Kirr urged the nation to ""remain calm"".

,,,reliable,,"The South African government has said it will not take part in ""counterproductive megaphone diplomacy"" following a fresh social media post by US President Donald Trump repeating his claim that Pretoria was confiscating land. Trump extended his invitation to relocate those seeking ""to flee [South Africa] for reasons of safety"" to all farmers and offered them citizenship. South Africa has previously said that Trump has misunderstood the country's new land expropriation act. But it has already led to the US president freezing financial aid to the country. Responding to the latest statement, the government said that South Africa was still committed to building a mutually beneficial trade, political and diplomatic relationship with the Trump administration. A spokesperson added that the relationship between both countries should be based on mutual respect. South Africa's new land law was signed in January, and allows land seizures without compensation in certain circumstances. In his executive order last month that stopped aid to South Africa, Trump alleged there was discrimination against the white Afrikaner minority, descendants of Dutch and French settlers. The US president said their land was being seized without compensation, something the South African government denies. He also offered refugee status to Afrikaner farmers, despite vowing to crack down on immigration. On Friday, Trump said any farmer, not just Afrikaner ones, could relocate to the US. The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics. Land ownership has been a contentious issue in South Africa with most private farmland owned by white people, 30 years after the end of the racist system of apartheid. There have been continuous calls for the government to address land reform and deal with the past injustices of racial segregation. The new law allows for expropriation without compensation only in circumstances where it is ""just and equitable and in the public interest"" to do so. American funding to HIV programmes in South Africa was terminated last week.

,,,reliable,,"Fifa's decision to ban for life a former Gabonese youth coach found guilty of sexually abusing players is a ""positive first step"", but there are ""many more perpetrators"", an official at global players' union Fifpro told the BBC. On Tuesday Fifa ruled that Patrick Assoumou Eyi, who was head coach of Gabon's national youth teams for decades, had sexually abused multiple young boys throughout his career. Eyi was named in a 2023 BBC Africa Eye investigation into the widespread allegations of abuse plaguing Gabonese football. In the investigation, a former Gabonese international said Eyi held the ""position of a god"" as he had the power to decide who would play for Gabon's youth teams. Eyi - known widely as Capello - is ""just one man that has been sanctioned"" and there are ""many more perpetrators"" within Gabonese football, Fifpro legal counsel Loic Alves told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. ""It is a positive first step, but it is just the first step,"" Mr Alves said. Eyi had admitted charges of raping, grooming and exploiting young players after allegations were first reported by the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2021. Fifa's independent ethics committee launched its investigation into Eyi later that year. As well as being banned for life, Eyi has been fined one million Swiss francs (£880,000; $1.1m). He is currently being held in prison. ""The investigation into Mr Eyi concerns complaints from at least four male football players who accused him of sexual abuse between 2006 and 2021. Most of these incidents occurred while the players were minors,"" Fifa's statement said. One of Eyi's alleged victims, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC on Wednesday he was pleased about the ban. ""But on the other hand, I'm not satisfied because I don't want us to stop there. It's a whole network, a system that needs to be dismantled, with many predators running free,"" they said. In 2023, BBC Africa spoke to more that 30 witnesses who told of a sexual abuse network that had afflicted all levels of Gabonese football for three decades. One victim said he was abused as a teenager at an under-17 football camp. Another, who played for Gabon's national team for several years, said he was assaulted from the age of 14. Along with the perpetrators of the abuse, governing bodies such as Fifa and Gabon's national football federation, Fegafoot, have faced accusations that they failed to protect young victims. Both bodies denied the allegations made against them. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"At least a dozen people were injured after Mozambican police violently dispersed a protest led by opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane, the runner-up in last year's disputed presidential election, Mondlane's team and a civil society group say. Eyewitnesses and Mondlane's aides said the police fired live rounds at the opposition leader's convoy and the anti-government protesters who had joined him on the streets of the capital, Maputo, on Wednesday. Neither the police nor the authorities have commented. The protests came as President Daniel Chapo, who took office in January, was due to sign a deal after talks with other political parties to end months of protests over the disputed election. Mondlane, who has been calling for the protests, was excluded from the talks leading to the ceremony. A communique from Mondlane's office said the opposition leader had been leading a procession on Wednesday afternoon when his convoy came under fire. ""A contingent of the UIR [a rapid intervention police unit] rammed into Venâncio Mondlane's convoy and began a barrage of gunfire, using live ammunition and tear gas,"" it added. In response to the incident, Interior Minister Paulo Chachine told reporters that the police had a mission to prevent any attempt to disrupt the deal-signing ceremony. He denied that there had been an attempt to kill Mondlane. Sixteen people were injured, according to local civil society group Plataforma Decide. The BBC has not been able to confirm the casualty figures. Mondlane's team said two children from a nearby school had died from the shooting. It said 16 people had been injured, including their camera person, with others seriously affected by tear gas. In a statement, it said Mondlane's condition was ""unknown, and his whereabouts are causing concern among his entire team"". A video shared on social media shows the moment when gunshots started ringing out as the procession approached what looks like an armoured vehicle on the streets. People run for safety and the crowds disappear, while the gunfire continues. More images of people bloodied from the incident have also been shared online. A witness, who was among the protesters, told the AFP news agency that police had started shooting, as if it was an ""ambush scenario. It was just a march"". ""I saw some people bleeding from their wounds. My friend was wounded in the leg. I also saw a child who was shot and lost his life in hospital,"" AFP quoted 27-year old protester Silvestre Alexandre as saying. Mozambique's former colonial power, Portugal, has condemned ""the unacceptable attack on Venâncio Mondlane's convoy"" while calling for ""restraint from violence and respect for fundamental rights"". In a post on X, the Portuguese foreign affairs ministry has also offered condolences to the bereaved families. Since President Chapo took over in January, he has made promises for a broad political dialogue that would include various sectors of the society, in order to end the country's post-election crisis. Some analysts have however criticised him for excluding Mondlane from the talks. On Wednesday, Mondlane condemned the political deal, calling it ""an agreement of people without the people"". He said that protests would continue. ""If they don't do what the people want, they won't govern Mozambique,"" he said. Since October, close to 400 people have died in violence linked to the protests, according to civil society organisations. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"The arrest of an army general from South Sudan's main opposition is a ""grave violation"" of the peace deal that ended a five-year civil war, an opposition spokesperson has told the BBC. Gen Gabriel Duop Lam was arrested earlier this week, along with other senior officials of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM-IO). The detainees are all allies of Vice-President Riek Machar, whose rift with President Salva Kiir sparked a devastating war in 2013. On Thursday morning, Machar's spokesperson said that the SPLM-IO did not know how their officials were or where they were being held. ""We are doing our best to avoid any escalation to the situation, however we need our partners in peace to demonstrate the political will to assure that this country will not go back to war again,"" Puok Both Baluang told the BBC's Newsday programme. President Kiir has insisted that South Sudan will not return to war, government spokesperson Michael Makuei told reporters in the capital Juba on Wednesday. Makuei added that the opposition figures were arrested because they were ""in conflict with the law"". South Sudan is the world's newest nation, after seceding from Sudan in 2011. But just two years later, a civil war erupted when Kiir sacked his entire cabinet and accused Machar of instigating a failed coup. After five years, with 400,000 lives lost, and 2.5 million people forced from their homes, a peace deal was agreed in 2018. But it has been fraught ever since. Gen Lam is in charge of the military wing of the opposition party, which is yet to be integrated into the army. He was taken into custody on Tuesday. Another Machar ally, Oil Minister Puot Kang Chol, was taken by security forces in the middle of the night. Machar's house in the capital, Juba, was surrounded by troops from the South Sudanese army overnight before they were later withdrawn. All other senior military officials allied with Machar have been placed under house arrest, the BBC understands. The arrests follow reports that the White Army militia had seized a strategic town in Upper Nile state close to the Ethiopian border, after clashes with government troops. The White Army fought alongside Machar during the civil war. Some in the army, loyal to Kiir, have accused Machar's allies of supporting the rebels. Machar's spokesperson told the BBC that the current fighting between the White Army and security forces ""would have been avoided"" if the leadership of the national army had abided by the peace agreement. The UN and African Union have warned that the violence in this area could potentially spread. Ter Manyang, head of the Juba-based Center for Peace and Advocacy, told Reuters that the fighting in this area could threaten the peace deal. ""The country is likely to slide to war unless the situation is managed by the top leadership of the country,"" he said.

,,,reliable,,"The petition filed by a Nigerian senator alleging sexual harassment by the senate president has been dismissed. Godswill Akpabio, one of the country’s most senior politicians, on Wednesday denied the allegations made against him by Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan. The ethics committee which was mandated to look at the petition cited procedural violations and legal constraints at a hearing afterwards. ""The petition runs contrary to Senate rules and cannot be entertained,"" said chairman of the ethics committee senator Neda Imasuen. He added that Uduaghan had personally signed the petition instead of having it endorsed by another individual, violating an order of the senate. In an interview with Arise Television on Friday, Senator Uduaghan alleged that Akpabio had made inappropriate advances towards her during a visit to his residence in southern Akwa Ibom state, on 8 December 2023. She further alleged that Akpabio had, on a separate occasion, insinuated that she should ""take care of him"" if she wanted her motions to receive favourable consideration in the senate. The senator alleged that Akpabio was behaving like a university lecturer who consistently failed his student who had refused to sleep with him. But this was denied by Akpabio. ""At no time did I ever harass any woman. I was raised very well by my late single mother, and I have always upheld respect for women. I was even awarded the most gender-friendly governor in Nigeria,"" he noted. The issue has generated huge debate in Nigeria with many calling for an independent investigation. In a social media post, one of Akpabio's predecessors as senate president, Bukola Saraki, said the issues raised were too serious to be simply brushed aside. Earlier on Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.'' Senator Uduaghan used Wednesday's plenary session to submit the petition calling for an investigation into Akpabio's behaviour. As the president, it was Akpabio who allowed Uduaghan to submit the petition. Before becoming senate president less than two years ago, Akpabio was governor of the oil-rich Akwa Ibom state for eight years and also minister of Niger Delta affairs under former President Muhammadu Buhari.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked a crowded market at Abu Shouk, a camp on the outskirts of the city of el-Fasher, for roughly two hours on Tuesday evening, a local official told the BBC. The camp is home to over half a million displaced people and the assault on its market is the second in three days. El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for almost a year. Tuesday's attack on Abu Shouk took place at the busiest time of day. The camp's population are mostly Muslims, who are observing the holy month of Ramadan, and many were out shopping at the market, preparing to break their fast for the day. The shelling caused several injuries, ranging from mild to severe, Dr Ibrahim Nadyan, a medic at el-Fasher's last functioning hospital, told the BBC. Abu Shouk was also shelled by the RSF on Sunday, in an attack that that killed six civilians, local health volunteers said. The RSF has not commented on either Sunday or Tuesday's attack. Since it erupted in April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine. Both the RSF and the army have been accused of committing atrocities, with the RSF accused of committed a genocide in Darfur against the region's non-Arabic groups. The conflict has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east, while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Jordan Bita preferred to risk his life swimming across a roaring river than stay at home and be conscripted by rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The 25-year-old clung on to a black bin bag with some possessions as he used the strong currents to navigate his way across the Rusizi river, which forms the border between DR Congo and Burundi. This was the last stage in a desperate journey to escape to safety in Burundi as the conflict in eastern DR Congo escalates, with M23 rebels capturing the cities of Goma and Bukavu in the last five weeks. ""I managed to flee safely… because I was crossing through the forest and moving along the bushes instead of the main road,"" he told the BBC after climbing up the bank on the Burundian side and wiping the water from his face. ""This is because M23 fighters are everywhere and they are forcing us to join them to fight against the government,"" he said. Burundian troops are monitoring the riverbank in Cibitoke province in the north-west where Congolese families are crossing. They are among nearly 70,000 people who have sought refuge here over the last month as the M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda, Burundi's neighbours to the north - continue to advance south in DR Congo. At the end of January they took the major hub of Goma in DR Congo's North Kivu province and in mid-February Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, fell. Mr Bita's luggage was thoroughly checked on the orders of Burundian troops - no weapons are allowed in. Afterwards, he picked up his bag and carried it on his head, making his way up a steep hill to the nearest refugee camp about 12km (seven miles) away in the town of Rugombo.

,,,reliable,,"Warning: This article contains details of sexual violence that some people may find distressing Armed men are raping and sexually assaulting children as young as one during Sudan's civil war, says the UN children's agency, Unicef. So traumatised are the survivors that some say they have attempted to end their lives. Mass sexual violence has been widely documented as a weapon of war in the country's nearly two-year conflict. But Unicef's report is the first detailed account about the impact of rape on young children in Sudan. A third of the victims were boys, who typically face ""unique challenges"" in reporting such crimes and seeking the help they need. Unicef says that, although 221 rape cases against children have been officially reported since the start of 2024, the true number is likely to be much higher. Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups. The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war. Perhaps its most shocking revelation is that 16 of the victims were under the age of five years, including four infants. Unicef does not say who is responsible, but other UN investigations have blamed the majority of rapes on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying RSF fighters had a pattern of using sexual violence to terrorise civilians and suppress opposition to their advances. The RSF, which is fighting this war against its former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces, has denied any wrongdoing. ""Children as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,"" said Unicef executive director Catherine Russell. ""Millions of children in Sudan are at risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence, which is being used as a tactic of war. This is an abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime. It must stop."" According to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan. The UN humanitarian response for Sudan is already underfunded. Recent cuts in US aid are expected to reduce programmes to help the victims even further. Harrowing details in Unicef's report underscore the dire situation. ""After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,"" recalls Omnia (not her real name), an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls. ""Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood. She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious. Each of them cries and speaks incoherently. During the 19 days I spent there, I reached a point where I wanted to end my life."" Unicef says the attacks included armed men storming homes and demanding that the girls be surrendered, raping some of them in front of their loved ones. Victims were sometimes left with serious injuries and unwanted pregnancies. In addition to the 221 rapes reported by Unicief were an additional 77 cases of sexual assault against children - mostly attempted rape. As a fractured nation at war, Sudan is one of the most challenging places on earth to access services and frontline workers. ""The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,"" said Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the UN's fact-finding mission when its previous report was published in October. The vast number of people displaced by the war has made women and children more vulnerable to attack – three out of four school-age girls are out of school, the UN says. The devastating outcome of these crimes is aggravated by the fact that victims have few places to turn to for medical help, because many medical facilities have been destroyed, looted or occupied by the warring parties. Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children. Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities. The activists relied quite heavily on US aid, and most have been forced to shut down, according to a Sudanese coordinating committee that monitors them. More broadly, the UN organization dedicated to protecting women's rights says local organisations led by women are vital in delivering support to survivors of sexual violence. But they receive less than 2% of the total funding of the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Fund. The BBC learned that at least one of these local groups, known as ""She Leads"", was forced to close when US funding was stopped. It was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative. Those who have been raped by armed men ""don't have the luxury of being depressed,"" she told the BBC. The demands of war – finding food, needing to flee – leave no space to deal with trauma, she added. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Gabon's military leader Gen Brice Oligui Nguema has announced his intention to run for president in next month's election. Nguema seized power in 2023 in a coup that ended the long-standing rule of the Bongo family. He then pledged to hand over power to civilians. The country has however since passed a new constitution and electoral code that critics argue were designed to favour a bid for the presidency by the junta leader. Nguema told the Gabonese people on Monday that he had decided to run in the 12 April election ""after careful reflection and in response to your many appeals"". Addressing supporters during a heavy downpour in the capital, Libreville, he declared his readiness to change the fortunes of the oil-rich country. ""I am a builder and I need your courage, your strength, to build this country,"" the the coup leader, who had just turned 50, said. The announcement followed months of speculation about his intentions to officially occupy the country's top seat. On Saturday, Nguema told the military in a meeting that he was aware of their desire to see him run in the election and urged them to vote. He told the defence forces he had heard their calls. ""I listened to you and, believe me, I understood you,"" adding, ""I will get back to you within the next few days"". There has been speculation that Nguema had left the army, as a requirement to run for the presidency – but that has since been denied by his spokesman. A Facebook page associated with Nguema clarified on Monday that he was required to abandon his military uniform temporarily while running for election. The page, Infos CTRI Officiel, said that he would have to permanently leave the military if he won the election. ""If he's not elected, he will return to the barracks,"" it said. The Nguema-led junta is credited for ending 55 years of the Bongo dynasty. Ali Bongo had ruled for 14 years before he was toppled. He took office after the death of his father, Omar Bongo, who had been president for 41 years. Last month, the president of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea, Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, encouraged the Gabonese people to support Nguema for a better future for their country. Some opposition and civil society groups in Gabon have however been urging the military leader to honour his word and leave power to civilians after the transition.

,,,reliable,,"A group of 10 MPs in Ghana have resubmitted a controversial bill that would impose some of the toughest restrictions on LGBT rights in Africa. The bill prescribes a three-year jail term for people who identify as gay, and five to 10 years for promoters and advocates. The legislation was passed by parliament last year, but the former President, Nana Akufo-Addo, declined to sign it into law before leaving office in January, citing legal challenges. It has been widely condemned by both local and international human rights groups, with some describing it as draconian. At the dissolution of the previous parliament ahead of last December's general election, all bills that had not completed the legislative process, including receiving the president's signature, were dropped. It is unclear whether the speaker of the new parliament will admit the bill for consideration. Gay sex is already punishable by up to three years in prison in the conservative West African country. President John Mahama has said he would prefer the bill to be state-sponsored, ensuring broader support and consultation. ""I do think that we should have a conversation on it again so that all of us, if we decide to move that bill forward, move it forward with a consensus,"" he said. Supporters claim the legislation would help preserve what they consider to be Ghanaian culture and family values. However rights groups have decried the legislation. ""The anti-LGBT rights bill is inconsistent with Ghana's long-standing tradition of peace, tolerance, and hospitality and flies in the face of the country's international human rights obligations,"" said Human Rights Watch researcher Larissa Kojoué last year. ""Such a law would not only further erode the rule of law in Ghana, but could also lead to further gratuitous violence against LGBT people and their allies."" Va-Bene Elikem Fiatsi, a Ghanaian trans woman and LGBT activist, told the Reuters news agency the bill's reintroduction was ""disheartening and hard to process"" but insisted LGBT activism would continue. The bill's potential impact on Ghana's economy is a significant concern. The country's former finance minister warned that passing the bill could result in Ghana losing up to $3.8bn (£2.9bn) in development funding from the World Bank and affecting its $3bn (£2.3bn) IMF support programme.

""It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,"" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett. ""I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction."" Adichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old. While she was pregnant, she had a ""very foggy feeling"" and ""couldn't think as clearly,"" she says. ""I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,"" she says. Adichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count. The book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan. ""I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,"" she says. Adichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyoncé on her 2013 song Flawless. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI). Adichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. ""I'm determined to raise good men,"" she says. ""I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,"" she continues. Compared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many ""wholesome"" role models. ""This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,"" she says. The writer adds that she wants her sons to be ""the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up"". As well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents. ""Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,"" she says. Adichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. ""Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,"" she says. The novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel. When she started writing the book - after her mother died - ""I did not think I was writing about my mother,"" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was ""so much about mothers and daughters"" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing. ""I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,"" Adichie says. ""I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation."" As someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance. The author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, ""increasingly stupid"". She argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says ""we should never think that we can somehow replace"". Even using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says. ""The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?""",,,,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on 'terrifying' writer's block during pregnancy,"Grace Dean, BBC News",,,,,,,1

The Hisbah official added that they sometimes get tip-offs when people are seen eating. ""We do get calls from people who are enraged after seeing people eating in public and we act fast by going to the area to make arrests."" He also confirmed the arrest of other people who were seen with ""inappropriate haircuts"", wearing shorts above the knee and tricycle drivers mixing male and female passengers. Last year, those arrested for not fasting were freed after promising to fast, while the relatives or guardians of some of them were summoned and ordered to monitor them to make sure they fast. Those arrested this year were not so lucky as they will have to face the court. Just over two decades ago, Sharia, or Islamic law, was introduced to work alongside secular law in 12 of Nigeria's northern states that have a majority Muslim population. Sharia does not apply to the Christian minorities living in the states. Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, has a special significance in Islam. It is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives. The fast is observed during daylight hours.

Kelly Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn were arrested after Smith's daughter, Joshlin, went missing from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, in February last year. Joshlin's disappearance sent shockwaves across South Africa and despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found. All three have pleaded not guilty to charges of human trafficking and kidnapping. Ms Smith initially said that Joshlin had gone missing after she left the young girl in Mr Appollis's care. Prosecutors later accused her of having ""sold, delivered or exchanged"" the six-year-old and lied about her disappearance. An intense and widespread search then ensued for the young girl but attention soon turned to Ms Smith after her friend and former co-accused, Lorentia Lombaard, turned state witness, according to South Africa's Daily Maverick news site.

Embalo was elected for a five-year term in December 2019, and the standoff over when it should end has heightened tensions in a country that has experienced several military coups since independence in 1974. There have been two attempts to overthrow Embalo, the latest in December 2023. This led him to dissolve the opposition-dominated parliament. The opposition on Thursday called for a nationwide strike, on the day they said the president's term was expiring, with the government deploying security forces across the capital. A day earlier, Embalo visited Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Despite growing international pressure, the Democratic Republic of Congo is standing firm on its decision not to have direct talks with the M23 rebel group that has made major advances in the east of the country in recent months. Last week, the UK government added to calls for the group to be part of an ""inclusive dialogue"" to help find a political solution to the conflict. But in an interview with the BBC, DR Congo Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka said her government wants to negotiate with neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of backing the M23. At least 8,500 people have been killed since fighting escalated in January, according to the Congolese authorities. Hundreds of thousands have also been forced from their homes amid the chaos triggered by the fighting, in which UN experts and others see Rwanda as having a key role. ""The fact remains that the aggressor of the territorial integrity and of the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Congo is Rwanda,"" Suminwa Tuluka said, citing a UN experts' report from last year that stated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops had crossed into Congolese territory and were fighting alongside the M23. Peace talks brokered by Angola hit a deadlock last December after Rwanda demanded that the Congolese government talk directly to the M23. The rebel group then advanced swiftly, taking control of the cities of Goma and Bukavu in January and February. At a joint East and Southern African mediation effort last month, regional leaders called for a ceasefire, the exit of ""uninvited foreign armed forces"" from Congolese territory and also urged for direct negotiations between ""state and non-state parties... including M23"". Rwandan President Paul Kagame did not deny the presence of his troops in DR Congo when asked about it. ""I don't know,"" he said in a CNN interview. The conflict across the border has seen his country, often viewed as a darling of the West, now lose favour fast across the board. Pressure is mounting on it to withdraw its forces from Congolese soil. ""But it has not yet effectively done so,"" Suminwa Tuluka said. She welcomed US sanctions imposed on Rwandan government minister James Kabarebe, saying they would help ""put pressure on the aggressors"". Rwanda, however, dismissed them as ""unjustified and ineffective in resolving the crisis"". The European Commission for its part has suspended ""defence consultations"" and placed ""under review"" a memorandum of understanding it signed last year with Rwanda on raw materials. The Congolese prime minister welcomed the EU Commission's decisions, saying that ""the illegal exploitation of resources - that is one of the causes of the conflict"". DR Congo accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda denies. Adding to the chorus against Rwanda, the UK said last week that among other measures it would pause aid except the money meant for the poorest and most vulnerable groups, unless the country withdraws its troops, engages ""meaningfully"" in talks and a ceasefire is achieved. Rwanda described the decision as ""punitive"", saying it was unreasonable to expect it to compromise its national security. The Congolese prime minister said that Rwanda was ignoring all the calls to withdraw its troops. ""So, who is standing in the way of [resolving the conflict]? It is not the Congolese government,"" she argued. Rwanda has previously acknowledged deploying its forces ""defensively and offensively"" during the ongoing conflict, claiming the right to defend its territory. It has also repeatedly accused the Congolese government of harbouring and working with the militant group the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose members include fighters from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Asked about that, Suminwa Tuluka denied that the Congolese army works with FDLR rebels, but said her country would engage in a process of ""neutralising"" the militants. When it came to what would solve the problem if direct talks with the M23 were ruled out, the prime minister said that along with negotiating with Rwanda, the answer was simple for what would guarantee a ceasefire. ""Ensure that Rwandan troops withdraw from Congolese territory and that their M23 stop killing the Congolese populations,"" she said. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"The army of the Democratic Republic of Congo has accused Rwanda of dressing up prisoners in military uniforms in an effort to pass them off as newly-captured rebels linked to the Rwandan genocide. It comes after Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo said they had captured fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) - a militia founded by ethnic Hutus who took part in the 1994 genocide against Rwanda's Tutsis. But the DR Congo military said a video allegedly showing the handover of 20 FDLR rebels at a border crossing was ""faked"". M23 fighters have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region. The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. In its statement, the Congolese military said the Rwandan video was a ""faked incident in poor taste orchestrated with the sole aim of discrediting our army"". It said Rwanda had taken old FDLR prisoners and dressed them in new military uniforms to claim they had been newly captured in Goma. ""This is part of the Rwandan strategy to justify the invasion of parts of the DRC's territory,"" it added. Rwanda has used the presence of FDLR forces in eastern DR Congo to justify its support for the M23. The country previously denied backing the M23, but it has also stressed that due to the FDLR presence in eastern DR Congo it has a right to take military action there. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. UN experts also reported last year that the Congolese military had been using several armed groups, including the FDLR, as proxies in the fight against the M23. The genocide in Rwanda took place over 100 days in 1994. The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the FDLR. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this ""genocidal militia"" as an existential threat. On Thursday, gunfire and explosions ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east. Videos showed chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled. M23 rebels seized Bukavu from government forces last month following their rapid advance through the region. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of an alliance of rebel groups that includes the M23. The rebels accused DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on ""a foreign army"" that he said was operating in the east.

,,,reliable,,"The love life of South Africa's Zulu king has the country agog - and has scandalised his socially conservative subjects as he messes with tradition by seeking a divorce. Polygamy is part of Zulu culture, but King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has taken the unusual step of going to court to divorce his first wife, Queen Ntokozo kaMayisela. ""Everyone was puzzled. People were not expecting the king to go so far as to file for divorce,"" Prof Gugu Mazibuko, a cultural expert at South Africa's University of Johannesburg, told the BBC. ""In Zulu culture, there is no divorce. You are not supposed to chase away your wife,"" she said. Regarded as the ""lion of the nation"", the Zulu king is the custodian of age-old traditions that place marriage and polygamy at the heart of royal success. His role within South Africa may only be ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential, with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars. The monarch - who grew up in neighbouring Eswatini, studied in the US and came to the throne in 2021 - seems to court controversy. His coronation was challenged in court by his elder half-brother, who has been trying to snatch the crown from him. His second marriage appears to be shaky, his attempt to take a third wife hit the buffers and there are also reports of another dalliance with a young princess. However, the 50-year-old's troubled personal life used to be discussed in hushed tones - that is until he filed divorce papers in December. Prof Mazibuko acknowledged that historical records appeared to suggest that a Zulu monarch in the 20th Century had divorced one of his queens, but it had been a ""top royal secret"", given royal divorce is not the norm. ""If a marriage does not work out, the wife will still live in the king's homestead. She will be given her own space. She will not have a relationship with the king, but she and her children will be well-cared for."" It was just before his accession to the throne - following the sudden death of his father and mother four years ago - that the then-Prince Misuzulu married Ntokozo Mayisela. The two were already a couple and had two children together, but according to another cultural expert, Prof Musa Xulu of the University of Zululand, the decision to marry appeared be be hurried. ""It seems as though he felt he could not be a king without a wife,"" he told the BBC. Queen kaMayisela came from an ""ordinary family"" - as many of the wives of Zulu kings do - in a small mining town in KwaZulu-Natal province. It was as a cabaret singer performing at a restaurant in the coastal city of Durban that she caught the royal eye, the academic said. Her senior status in the family was made clear at the king's state coronation in December 2022 when she sat by his side. But her position is now under threat, with the monarch saying in court papers that they have not lived as husband and wife for at least year and their marriage has irretrievably broken down. The palace followed this by sending out invitations for the king's wedding to a new bride, Nomzamo Myeni, set to take place in late January. The bride-price, known as lobola, had already been paid in cattle - a prized asset in Zulu culture. Queen kaMayisela did not take any of this lying down, instituting separate court action to halt the wedding, which was postponed as a result. Her argument was that the king - known to his subjects as ""Ingonyama"", meaning Lion - would be committing the offence of ""bigamy"" without first ""converting"" his civil marriage to her into a traditional Zulu marriage. But the judge threw out her case, saying she had had a ""turnaround"" in attitude as she had already agreed her husband could take other wives. He noted the monarch had already done so - marrying Nozizwe kaMulela, the MD of Eswatini Bank, in 2022. Prof Mazibuko explained that polygamy was not initially part of Zulu culture, in fact the first two kings were bachelors. But it was embraced by their successors - King Misuzulu is the ninth monarch of the Zulu nation - and has become part of Zulu culture. ""That's how we build families, especially the royal family,"" Prof Mazibuko said. Queen kaMulela comes from an influential family in Eswatini and the marriage was apparently arranged to strengthen the ties between the royal families. Yet it is unclear whether the pair are still in a relationship, as the high-powered banker has not been spotted at Zulu cultural events for a while - with speculation their final marriage rituals have not been completed. The current king's various marriage problems seem to stem from the fact that tradition has not been properly followed. In the case of the first wife, he opted for a modern-day marriage, without a traditional wedding. ""For a marriage to be perfected under Zulu custom, there has to be a public gathering, with song and dance,"" Prof Xulu said. ""You, as the bride, must lead with a solo song and the bride-maids dance with you, and you carry a spear which you give to the king - and then there is no going back."" This has left Queen kaMayisela without the protection of tradition - and only the offer of monthly maintenance of $1,100 (£850) for a year, though she was likely to demand more before returning to the life of a commoner, Prof Xulu said. In the case of the second wife, the academic said lobola had been paid in January 2022, but royal insiders suggest the king felt ""those who went to pay didn't have the authority to do so"" - plus this union has not been marked with a public ceremony. The fortunes of the would-be third wife, Nomzamo Myeni, remain unclear as the king failed to marry her in January despite the court giving the go-ahead. Prof Xulu said that in Zulu culture a ""postponed"" marriage usually never takes place. Though Ms Myeni is still being seen with the king, accompanying him to a state event last week where she was referred to as a queen, suggesting their wedding may take place once the king's divorce goes through. Yet as a commoner she would bring no powerful connections with her, which may be why one of the monarch's aides recently confirmed to local media there was ""a new queen-to-be"" - Sihle Mdluli, who hails from the royal family of a small ethnic group in South Africa. The aide suggested she might be named ""the mother of the nation"" - a title that would make her the most senior queen with her children likely heirs. But Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if that wedding also failed to take place, as the king's relationships all seemed to run into trouble. ""I am not sure whether he was ready to be king, and whether he has good advisers,"" the academic said. He pointed out that the monarch had also been behaving erratically in his public life, sacking several senior officials in his retinue. On top of this, he has installed himself as the chairman of the board of a financially lucrative land trust, of which he is the sole trustee. The trust was controversially established shortly before South Africa became a democracy in 1994, giving it control of about 2.8 million hectares (seven million acres) of land in KwaZulu-Natal. King Misuzulu has also suspended all members of the board, bar one, accusing them of being uncooperative. He did this against the advice of the government, which pointed out that as chairman he would be required to account to parliament about the trust's operations - something that would not be in keeping with his status as a constitutional monarch. The dispute remains unresolved, giving the government a major political headache as it tries to avoid going head-to-head with the king. Prof Xulu said he would not be surprised if at some point a powerful rival faction within the royal family launched a fresh bid to dethrone him by asking the courts to rule that he is not ""fit and proper"" to be king. The monarch's half-brother, Prince Simakade Zulu, who is the late king's eldest son, has long coveted the crown, but his backers were outmanoeuvred by Misuzulu's allies in succession discussions. President Ramaphosa later gave Misuzulu a ""certificate of recognition"", paving the way for him to be funded by the government. But Prince Simakade's supporters did not give up - going to the High Court to declare his state coronation ""unlawful"" - and won. The court ruled that President Ramaphosa had failed to comply with the law, which required him to order an investigation into objections to Misuzulu's accession. The status quo remains, pending the outcome of an appeal. The scandals have the potential to weaken the king's position should it come to another tussle for the crown. Though Prof Mazibuko noted there had always been fierce competition for the Zulu crown - except these days it takes place in court instead of a bloody battlefield. ""He is not the first king to go through a lot,"" she said. ""I hope he survives, and everything settles down."" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Namibia's founding father Sam Nujoma was ""a giant among leaders"" and left behind ""the most precious gift of… freedom"", the country's President, Nangolo Mbumba, has said. He was speaking in front of the large crowd at Heroes' Acre, where the country's most revered citizens are buried, before Nujoma was laid to rest in a mausoleum. The leader of Namibia's independence struggle against apartheid South Africa died last month at the age of 95. Nujoma was seen as the last of a generation of African figures who headed anti-colonial movements and fought for freedom. ""Therefore his departure signals an end of an era, a founding father of Africa,"" President Mbumba said in an earlier speech at a national memorial service on Friday. ""We are not only mourning today, we are celebrating an extraordinary leader who has contributed significantly to our country's independence, who will continue to inspire us for many more years to come,"" Namibian Given Shiyukifein told the Reuters news agency. On Saturday, Nujoma's coffin, draped in the Namibian flag, was driven by a military gun carriage from the centre of the capital, Windhoek, where the body was lying in state, to the burial ground on the outskirts of the city. Mourners had been arriving since the early hours, the independent Namibian newspaper reported. It added that they waved flags and sang songs in his memory, including Sam Ouli Peni? (Sam, Where are you?) – a popular anthem from the period after independence in 1990. Among the dignitaries present were the presidents of neighbouring countries Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Nujoma, one of 10 children from a peasant family, was working on the railway in the late 1940s when he got a political education. He developed a passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism. He led the long fight for freedom from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, and helped found the liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s. As the country's first president – a position he held for 15 years until 2005 - Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability. His policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy. He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. Namibia, then known as South West Africa, was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One. It then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms. The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"More than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict. Officials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo last year. The patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu - two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks. ""We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster,"" Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC. Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever. According to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks. Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January. His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said. At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment. Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor. The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years. They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging ""voluntary returns"". ""Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to,"" Dr Muhindo said. His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC. ""Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions,"" Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC's mpox incident manager, said on Thursday. Over the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory. Dr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with ""high potential for higher transmissibility"" had also been detected in DR Congo. The country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of funding. The mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN children's agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week. But it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed. ""I first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there,"" Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC. ""I began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind."" He said he had seen ""so many"" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week. Dr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters. But this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"The UK's decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is ""punitive"", authorities in the East African country have said. In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda's support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo's government says. The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was ""critical"" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, ""excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable"". Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about £32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year. Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending ""future defence training assistance"", the statement said. These measures will last until ""significant progress"" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda's foreign ministry said the ""punitive measures"" announced by the UK government ""in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable"". ""The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC."" The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda. The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK's government. DR Congo's government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda. Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe. The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda's support for M23. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said. Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions were ""unjustified"". The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state.

The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction. The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced. The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying. Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports. The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. ""He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me."" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. ""I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,"" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men's block right next door called ""Safina"", she says. ""We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped."" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region. Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape. By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that ""at least 153 women had perished"", quoting ""reliable sources in the prison"". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. ""At one point I didn't know what was happening any more,"" she says. ""It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved."" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it. ""When I sleep at night, everything I've seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here."" Nadine says she was also raped by two men. ""They came with alcohol,"" she tells the BBC. ""They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here."" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out. ""I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,"" she says. ""I condemn the way the government is running things."" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children's clothing. Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them. Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says ""children started to die"" when tear gas was fired into the women's section. ""The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,"" Florence says. ""When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,"" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else. Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces. However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. ""You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.""",,,,'They took all the women here': Rape survivors recall horror of DR Congo jailbreak,"Orla Guerin, BBC News, Goma",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government. In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president's decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country's farmers. In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu's election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister. The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu's most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament. ""You don't address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture,"" said El-Rufai. ""Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries,"" he said. ""I have issues with many of them [Tinubu's policies], and I'm in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately."" The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made. El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party. ""As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party's candidate,” he noted. He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report. ""The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on,"" El-Rufai said.

,,,reliable,,"A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk. The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( £1.7m) to the group to help it ""further its messages of racial hatred and separation"". But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and ""contrary to public policy"". Trump has referred to the ""large-scale killing of farmers"" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were ""racist ownership laws"" and previously condemned the ""genocide of white people"". Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced. Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US. The court action was brought by Mr Gray's four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust. In it, they claimed that their brother had become ""obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa"" in the last 10 years of his life. He died in March 2022. Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed ""genocide"" would occur soon. ""That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to,"" Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light. Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group. The Boerelegioen describes itself as a ""civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property"". Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran. But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray's bequest made was ""vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary"" of his will. ""The only expression of the [Mr Gray's] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for 'training' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real,"" Judge Allie said. On the public policy issue, Mr Gray's siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to ""further... its messages of racial hatred and separation"". Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion. Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs in the court case. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances. The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics. But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned. Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut. It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected. The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023. The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods. ""People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,"" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. ""People are screaming from hunger in the streets."" The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was ""serving US interests"", and moved to begin dismantling USAID. The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice. The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes. The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations. The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID. It is a ""huge setback"" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms. The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN. Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works. ""It was ground-breaking,"" says Ms Tracy. ""The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria."" For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out. There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege. Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon ""we expect to see a lot of people starving"". Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID. ""I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],"" she said, ""but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was."" ""These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,"" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation. They are ""exhausted, traumatised and underfunded"" and ""we were scaling up to help them"". The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful. ""The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,"" it said in response to a BBC query. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances. In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan. Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries. ""I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,"" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month. The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further. ""We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,"" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director. He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. ""We are strained. It's extremely difficult."" They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, ""it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger"", says Ms Dagesh. Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority. ""But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,"" she said. Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people. They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing. Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape. Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods. They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight. With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders. Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise ""to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum"". It does not help that the agency was already underfunded. The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut ""everything"", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive. The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. ""We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,"" Mr Balde told the BBC. Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on ""very dangerous journeys"", he says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"American singer-songwriter John Legend has told the BBC he is unfazed by a public backlash against his decision to perform in Rwanda, despite the country's involvement in the war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. ""I don't believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders,"" he said after last week's concert in Kigali. In recent weeks, M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda, have seized the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the DR Congo. There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed. Critics argue that Legend could have made a powerful statement by pulling out of the concert, especially given his highly respected ""EGOT"" status as someone who has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.

,,,reliable,,"Kenya has received 17 mountain bongos - a very rare type of antelope - from a conservation centre in the United States. The antelopes are third-generation descendants of mountain bongos taken from Kenya in the 1960s. The return of the critically endangered animals, from the Rare Species Conservation Foundation in Florida, was hailed as a ""monumental step"" in Kenya's conservation efforts. From about 500 in the 1970s, less than 100 mountain bongos are estimated to remain in the wild in Kenya, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). This was due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal activities, disease and small fragmented populations, the KWS said. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano described the arrival of the bongos at the country's main airport on Sunday night as ""emotional and so cool"", and a benefit for Kenya's tourism and conservation sectors. The animals were taken to wildlife sanctuaries in Meru county near Mount Kenya, where they will be nurtured before they are gradually introduced to their natural habitat. Ms Miano said the mountain bongo, ""a species originally only found in Kenya, has suffered untold grief over the decades... dwindling to alarming proportions"". She said the plan was to grow the population to 700 by 2050. The mountain bongo, which has a bright chestnut-red colour with narrow white stripes, is the largest African forest-dwelling antelope, according to the KWS. It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a Critically Endangered species - with more individuals in captivity than in the wild. The first repatriation to Kenya was in 2004 when 18 mountain bongos were flown into the country. KWS director-general Erastus Kanga said Kenya was expecting another batch of the mountain bongos from zoos in Europe in the next three months. From captivity, the bongos have to go through a series of adaptation phases for them to build the immunity needed to survive in the wild. In 2022, the head of conservancy at Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (MKWC) told a Kenyan TV station that some of the bongos repatriated in 2004 had successfully been integrated into the wild and had started breeding. The MKWC official, Robert Aruho, however, said that others had died from tick-borne diseases, adding that building immunity takes time. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"The Sudanese army says it has broken a near two-year siege imposed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the key southern state capital of el-Obeid. The breakthrough came hours after the RSF signed a political charter in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to establish a breakaway government in areas under its control. The RSF and the army have been in a vicious battle for power since April 2023, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. El-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, is a strategic hub connecting the capital, Khartoum, to Darfur. This is the latest army advance in recent weeks following the recapture of several parts of Khartoum from the RSF. There was jubilation on the streets as Sudanese soldiers marched into the city. A military spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, confirmed the gains in a statement, saying army forces had destroyed RSF units. Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim said the move was a ""massive step"" in lifting the RSF siege of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, and would also allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Kordofan. Sudanese civil society activist Dallia Abdlemoniem told the BBC Newsday programme that the recapture of the city "" was ""huge"" and ""significant"". She said the RSF had ""held the civilians captive for nearly two years"" in the city. The situation there was ""horrific"", she said, adding that there had been no medical or food aid in an area considered ""to be very risky in terms of famine and malnutrition"". She said she hoped more aid would now be allowed in. ""Lifting the siege brings life back to the city,"" Ahmed Hussein, a 53-year-old trader in el-Obeid, told the AFP news agency. Ms Abdelmoniem said the army was ""making serious groundwork in terms of moving towards the west, which is where the RSF is mainly centred"". The latest fighting around el-Fasher has forced medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to halt operations at Zamzam, a famine-stricken camp nearby, which houses about 500,000 displaced people. MSF said it was a ""heartbreaking decision"" but it had ""little choice"" because it was too dangerous for its staff to operate there. Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians during the war, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Darfur. Both deny the accusations. Kenya's hosting of the RSF last week as it sought to form a parallel government was criticised by some human rights groups. On Sunday, Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Youssef said his country would ""not accept"" any country recognising ""a so-called parallel government"". Earlier, Sudan's military government had warned it would take retaliatory measures against Kenya and has since recalled its ambassador from Nairobi.

,,,reliable,,"For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant. Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood. ""I feel liberated,"" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own. The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as ""getting your tubes tied"". Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya's health ministry. It is unclear how many of these women didn't already have children. Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing. ""Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,"" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC. ""But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure."" Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult. ""Doctors don't typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,"" said Dr Bosire. Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children. She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading. Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation. ""I interacted with women's life stories that didn't feature children at all,"" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence. ""It made me realise that a life like this was possible."" She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off. It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£190; $230) at a private hospital. Ms Sironka felt that women's rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision. It made her fear that a woman's right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could. ""Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,"" she argued. When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life. And as for dating and relationships? ""I'm still thinking about it,"" she said with a shrug. And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood. Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation. Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster. She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure. ""I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,"" she told the BBC. Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation. ""I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,"" she said. Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau's decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms. After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution. When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance. She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God.

,,,reliable,,"Mali's military government says it is investigating allegations that soldiers ""coldly executed"" at least 24 civilians in the north of the country on Monday. That claim was made by a separatist Tuareg rebel alliance, called Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is battling the Malian government in the same region. The FLA accuse Malian forces and Russian Wagner mercenaries of intercepting two passenger vehicles travelling to Algeria from the Malian city of Gao and killing the civilians on board, including women and children. In a statement, army chief Gen Oumar Diarra said the allegations ""relayed by terrorist networks, allies and sponsors"" follow other ""unfounded"" claims against state forces. For many years, the Malian government has been struggling against both Tuareg rebels seeking a breakaway state in the north and jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. The military which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 hired Russian mercenaries from the paramilitary group Wagner to help improve security in the country. Both government forces and the Russians have often been accused by rights groups of committing gross human rights abuses against civilians, which they deny. Last month, Mali was one of three countries under military rule to leave the West African regional bloc Ecowas, after refusing its demands to restore civilian rule. The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger dealt a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group. Mali's military leaders also ended ties with former colonial power France, whose troops left the country in 2022 after more than a decade fighting Islamist insurgents. The following year, all 12,000 UN peacekeepers left Mali on the junta's instructions. Additional reporting by the BBC's Natasha Booty. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"An aid worker has died from gunshot wounds in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where Rwanda-backed rebels who captured two key cities in recent weeks are trying to seize more territory. Jerry Muhindo Kavali, 49, was injured two days ago by a bullet that struck the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) office in Masisi where he was working. He was taken to hospital in Goma for life-saving treatment but died of his wounds on Saturday. Colleagues say he was deeply dedicated to humanitarian work and ""always had a smile on his face"". Kavali's death has angered aid workers trying to help the tens of thousands of Congolese people whose lives have been destroyed by the war. ""Even war has its rules"", said MSF in response to the news. The town of Masisi, where the MSF worker was shot, has witnessed fierce fighting between militias allied with the Congolese army and rebels belonging to the M23 and Alliance Fleuve Congo rebel groups. The bullet that killed Kavali was ""one of many bullets to hit our premises over recent weeks"", the MSF head of programmes Stephan Goetghebuer said. Key areas already under M23 control include provincial capitals Goma and Bukavu, and the rebels appear to be continuing their advance. Eastern DR Congo is rich in minerals and this battle for control of the region partly has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It has been riven by conflict for more than 30 years and attempts in recent years to integrate rebels into the Congolese army have failed. Experts now fear what effects the conflict will have on the wider East Africa region. On Friday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the M23 offensive in eastern DR Congo, urging Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels, and saying they should immediately leave Congolese territory ""without preconditions"". This week, the US announced sanctions on M23 Spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka and Rwandan minister James Kabarebe for his alleged role in the conflict.

,,,reliable,,"The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region's two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted. Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese. For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians. Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo's vast mineral wealth. It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name. That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province. This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians. At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo. The perception that Congolese Tutsis are ""foreign"" can have deadly consequences. Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu's Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities. He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle's son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on this allegation. Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he ""wished the world knew"" his community was experiencing what he called a ""silent genocide"". Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu. ""I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (£120) to save myself from being imprisoned,"" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23's cause. Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa. Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority. Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo. As DR Congo's Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities ""alternately empowered and the undermined"" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn't Say Its Name. In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960. But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were ""derived of their nationality and left stateless"", a UN report noted. In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996. It also states that ""many"" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats. Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community. But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites ""hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence"", the experts said. There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 ""in an apparent case of ethnic hatred"". Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment. Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns. He told the BBC he had seen ""pretty terrifying"" social media posts over the past few weeks - ""a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they're Rwandan"". Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23's current uprising, Mr Stearns says ""many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels"". The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President Félix Tshisekedi said he had ""had enough"" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo.",,,,How DR Congo's Tutsis become foreigners in their own country,"Wedaeli Chibelushi, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Nigeria's ex-military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida has expressed deep regret for the first time for annulling the results of the 1993 presidential election. The poll was supposed to bring about an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. The date of the vote – 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day. Gen Babangida was forced to resign. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated. Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place. The former military leader, 83, expressed his regret at the launch of his autobiography A Journey in Service in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993,"" he told the audience made up of the cream of Nigerian society, including Tinubu, two former presidents – Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan - and two other ex-military leaders, Abdulsalam Abubakar and Yakubu Gowon. ""However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process. ""That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret."" Gen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, also acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election. However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. For three decades, the circumstances surrounding the 1993 election have been shrouded in controversy, with conflicting accounts emerging overtime. This new admission, seen as reopening old wounds, has triggered fresh debates rather than closure. Many people will be expecting the former military ruler to also provide answers to some questions relating to his policies at the time. Gen Babangida, who overthrew another military leader Muhammadu Buhari in 1985, led the county for eight years. Multiparty democracy did eventually return to Nigeria in 1999 with the election of Obasanjo – who had also been a former military leader – as president.

,,,reliable,,"Veteran Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been charged with treason in a civilian court after his controversial case was transferred from a military tribunal. Treason is a capital offence in Uganda and if found guilty the 68-year-old cold be sentenced to death. He was charged alongside two other suspects, but they did not enter a plea on the grounds that the charges against them could only be heard in a higher court. Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial. But a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month said that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordering all such cases to be transferred. The move angered President Museveni, who called it ""a wrong decision"". At the start of last week, Besigye had begun a hunger strike over his continued detention. The charges stem from accusations that he was plotting to remove Museveni from power by force. Friday was the first first time Besigye had appeared before a civilian court for formal charges, after the Supreme Court ruling. Visibly frail, he was wheeled before the Nakawa magistrate court in the capital, Kampala, alongside his aide and co-accused Obeid Lutale. The opposition politician has now called-off his hunger strike, his lawyer Erias Lukwago told journalists. According to the charge sheet presented before court, Besigye is accused of holding meetings in Switzerland, Greece and Kenya between 2023 and November last year in a plot to overturn the government. He was also accused of soliciting for military, financial and other logistical support to topple Museveni's government. Besigye was charged alongside Mr Lutale and Denis Oola, a military officer. Previous charges heard in the military court of illegal possession of ammunition and treachery were not included in the new charge sheet. During proceedings, Besigye's lawyer asked the court to order that he be transferred to a better health facility outside the prison but Magistrate Esther Nyadoi dismissed the application, saying she was unable to grant such a request. She ordered the accused to be remanded until next month to allow the prosecutor to finish the investigation. Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution. He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.

,,,reliable,,"The Rwandan government has condemned the US decision to sanction a government minister for his alleged role in the conflict in the east of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Announcing the financial sanctions on Thursday, the US Treasury Department said Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration James Kabarebe, a former army chief, was central to his country's support for the M23 rebel group. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controls in Britain and France, the US Treasury said. On Friday, the UK said there would be ""consequences"" for Rwanda over its alleged role in DR Congo. Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions would not resolve the conflict in the DR Congo, terming them ""unjustified and unfounded"". They come as the M23 appears to be continuing its advance after capturing two major cities in recent weeks in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo. The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has seized the cities of Goma and Bukavu - sparking a major humanitarian crisis that left families devastated. Western powers have accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 with arms and as well as backing from the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF), accusations Rwanda denies. The US Treasury Department on Thursday said Kabarebe was sanctioned because ""he is central to Rwanda's support"" for the M23 armed group. It said Kabarebe together with Kanyuka were ""linked to violence and human rights abuses"" in DR Congo. ""Today's action underscores our intent to hold accountable key officials and leaders like Kabarebe and Kanyuka, who are enabling the RDF and M23's destabilising activities in the eastern DRC,"" said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The United States remains committed to ensuring a peaceful resolution to this conflict."" But Rwanda dismissed the US action, saying Kigali's aim was only to secure its border and an ""irreversible end to the politics of armed ethnic extremism in our region"". ""Rwandans have the right to live in peace and without the perpetual threat of insecurity originating from the DRC,"" the ministry statement stated. ""Punitive measures, including sanctions, make no contribution toward long-term security, peace and stability for all the countries of the Great Lakes region,"" it added. DR Congo welcomed the US sanctions, saying it wanted to see more such measures. ""This marks the beginning of a long series of sanctions that we want to be more robust from the UN Security Council, the European Union and other partners in order to force Rwanda to withdraw its troops and cease its criminal activities on our soil,"" government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in a statement posted on social media. Addressing G20 foreign ministers in South Africa on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy termed the reported involvement of Rwandan troops a ""blatant breach of the UN Charter which risks spiralling into a regional conflict"".

,,,reliable,,"Malian film director Souleymane Cissé, one of the pioneers of African cinema, has died aged 84. His daughter, Mariam Cissé, confirmed his death at a clinic in the capital Bamako, expressing shock and mourning ""the loss of a man who dedicated his life to film and art"". The cause of his death has not been announced. Cissé gained international recognition in 1987 when his film Yeelen (The Light) won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the first film-maker from sub-Saharan Africa to win an award at the prestigious festival. His trailblazing career spanned more than 50 years, winning many accolades along the way. In 2023, Cissé was honoured by Cannes with a Carrosse d'Or award, usually given to directors who have ""marked the history of cinema with their boldness, their exacting standards and their intransigence in staging"". Cissé was also a double winner of the grand prize at the biennial Pan-African Film Festival, Fespaco. At the time of his death he had been due to travel to Burkina Faso to preside over the jury at the festival, which opens on Saturday. Tributes have been pouring in for Cissé for his dedication to African storytelling. Mali's Culture Minister Mamou Daffé lamented the loss ""of this monument of African cinema"", while fellow Malian director Boubacar Sidibé said the country's film industry was in ""mourning"". Film lovers have praised Cissé's works for their complexity, political engagement and deep humanity. His first feature film, Den Muso (The Young Girl) shot in 1975, was in the local Bambara language, and is considered an African classic. The film is about a young girl who is raped, becomes pregnant and is rejected by her family. The film was banned by the Malian authorities, and Cissé was jailed for having accepted French funding. He wrote the screenplay for his second film, Baara (Work), while in prison. He made other films including Finyè (The Wind) in 1981, and Yeelen (The Light), which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 1987. His last film in 1995 was Waati (Time). Cissé was born in Bamako, and spent part of his childhood in neighbouring Senegal. Later, he studied film in Russia's capital Moscow, becoming one of the first generation of African film-makers. Cissé went on to champion government support for and investment in the film industry. He was the founding president of the union representing West Africa's entrepreneurs in cinema and audiovisual arts. Cissé was often outspoken about other barriers to the spread of African cinema - criticising ""censorship"" and ""contempt"", and urging young film-makers not to act like ""beggars who must plead every time for financing from Europe"" but instead seek greater independence. Hours before his death, he reportedly urged Mali's military government to help the country's industry catch up with its continental rivals. ""It is not enough to make cinema, the works must also be visible,"" the AFP news agency quoted Cissé as saying. ""May the authorities help us with the construction of cinemas.""

,,,reliable,,"Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised. In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it. More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone. The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around. They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger. For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times. The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000. A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter's grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15. Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter's cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother's grave was stolen. In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter's cross. ""This is my child's grave - my fourth child,"" she said pointing towards the concrete cross. The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal. ""The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on,"" Ms Chumbi tells the BBC. ""There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles."" Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home. Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi's brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community. ""This is too bad… when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot,"" he tells the BBC. The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites. The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; £0.22-£0.28) per kilogramme. It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol. ""Metal dealers often buy without asking questions,"" says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market. Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants. The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law. Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities. ""In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison,"" Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC. He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase. Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods. ""If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police."" Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers. Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro's health officer, said the city's authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that ""this requires resources and time. ""It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow."" He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components. Tanzania's government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry. Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations. ""What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe,"" he told the BBC. Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out. Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places. ""Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track,"" he says. For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration. Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest. She is in the process of replacing her mother's cross for a second time - and, as in her daughter's case - is opting for concrete. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000. The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues.

Godongwana is a member of the African National Congress (ANC), which was forced to enter into a coalition after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year. His failure to table the budget sent shockwaves in South Africa, as it has never happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.

The treasures were sold, some to private collectors and others to museums like the Wereldmuseum in The Netherlands, which has displayed the artefacts for decades. The return of the 119 artefacts was the ""largest repatriation of Benin antiquities"", said Olugbile Holloway, director-general of Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). Despite the name, not all the statues are made of bronze. They include figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin's rulers, and an ivory mask. They were made during between the 15th and 19th Centuries. A transfer of agreement is due to be signed on Wednesday. Mr Holloway added that he hoped this would set a good example for other countries. In 2022, Germany was the first to return over 20 Benin bronzes in a bid to deal with its ""dark colonial history"". ""With this return, we are contributing to the redress of a historical injustice that is still felt today,"" said Dutch Minister of Culture, Education, and Science Eppo Bruins, reports the AFP news agency. The sculptures, prized for their beauty and technical artistry, are of spiritual and historical significance for the people from that part of Nigeria. Their theft still remains a point of pain for the descendants of those from the ancient Benin kingdom. This move may increase pressure on other institutions to return the Benin Bronzes, especially the British Museum, which has more than 900 artefacts. Protests and demonstrations have taken place outside the British Museum as part of a campaign for their return. However, an act of parliament prevents the British Museum from sending them back. For many in Nigeria, the Benin Bronzes are a potent reminder of the violence of colonialism. The NCMM has issued formal repatriation requests to museums across the world. Nigeria said it plans to open the Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City in 2026, designed by the British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, to house the largest collection of Benin Bronzes ever assembled.

,,,reliable,,"The execution-style killing of an openly gay imam, Muhsin Hendricks, in South Africa has left people in the LGBTQ+ community fearful for their safety - but also determined to forge ahead with the campaign to end their marginalisation in religious circles. Reverend Toni Kruger-Ayebazibwe, an openly gay Christian cleric, told the BBC that Hendricks was a ""gentle spirit"" who brought light into any room he occupied. ""The gap Muhsin leaves is massive,"" she said, adding that she knew for a fact that there were ""a large number of queer Muslims around the world who are grief stricken"". The 57-year-old was shot dead in what appeared to be a hit on Saturday in the small coastal city of Gqeberha. Initial reports that Cape Town-based Hendricks had been in Gqeberha to perform the wedding ceremony of a gay couple have been dismissed as untrue by his Al-Gurbaah Foundation. ""He was visiting Gqeberha to officiate the marriages of two interfaith heterosexual couples when he was tragically shot and killed,"" it said in a statement. It is unclear why the couples had asked Hendricks to oversee their ceremonies, but it suggests that he was pushing the boundaries, even in the last seconds of his life. Traditional imams in South Africa rarely, if ever, perform the marriage of a Muslim to a non-Muslim - something that Hendricks clearly had no issue with. He had, according to a faith leader that the BBC spoke to, conducted one such marriage ceremony and was on his way to conduct the next one when he was gunned down in his vehicle. Two leading bodies that represent imams - the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) and the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) - condemned Hendricks' killing. ""As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,"" the MJC said, while the UUCSA said it condemned ""all forms of extra-judicial killings"". However, Hendricks - who did his Islamic studies in Pakistan - was a pariah in their circles, as they hold the view that Islam prohibits same-sex relations. They pointedly referred to him as ""Mr Hendricks"", rather than by religious titles like imam or sheikh. In contrast, Hendricks' supporters hailed him as the world's first openly gay imam who made it possible for them to reconcile their sexuality with their Islamic faith. That he was a trail-blazer is not surprising - South Africa's constitution, adopted in 1996 after the end of white-minority rule, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation. Then in 2006, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. Once in a heterosexual marriage with children, Hendricks came out as gay in 1996 - and, according to The Conversation, he later broke another taboo by marrying a Hindu man. He then spearheaded the formation of The Inner Circle as ""an underground social and support group"" for queer Muslims. It started out at his home in Cape Town, and has ""proven to be very successful in helping Muslims who are queer to reconcile Islam with their sexuality"", The Inner Circle's website says. Despite South Africa having a thriving LGBTQ+ scene, members of the community still face some stigmatisation and violence. Only a few of the country's religious groups have adopted policies that are more favourable towards the community, among them the Dutch Reformed Church and the Methodist Church of Southern Africa. The Dutch Reformed Church was in 2019 forced by the courts to reinstate a policy it had introduced four years earlier, but then scrapped, allowing same-sex marriages and for gay and lesbian pastors to be in romantic relationships. The following year, the Methodist Church said that while it was ""not yet ready to apply for its ministers to officiate at same-sex marriages"", no congregant residing in a member country that recognised civil unions would be ""prevented from entering into such a union which can be as same-sex or opposite sex couples"". Reverend Ecclesia de Lange, the director at Inclusive and Affirming Ministries (IAM), told the BBC that even in instances where faith groups had adopted inclusive policies there were still ""pockets of very strong conservatism"". ""The traditional interpretations of sacred texts continue to exclude LGBTQ+ people, so the struggle for acceptance within faith communities remains ongoing,"" she said. Senior lecturer in Islamic Studies at South Africa's University of the Western Cape, Dr Fatima Essop, reflected on the ""distressing"" vitriolic content circulating on social media in the wake of Hendricks' killing. ""I just find that completely shocking and so far removed from our... Islamic tradition, which is all about compassion and mercy and preservation of human life,"" she told the BBC. Dr Essop added that while she understood some of the strong feelings against Hendricks' work, there was ""absolutely no justification, Islamic or otherwise, for this kind of violence"". And while the motive is unclear, Hendricks' killing - and the negative comments that followed - was likely to make people fearful to ""speak about their sexuality or sexual orientation"", Dr Essop said. Reverend Kruger-Ayebazibwe said that while Hendricks' shooting would make LGBTQ+ leaders rethink their security, it would not deter them from campaigning for change ""because the work matters too much"". Hendricks has already been buried at a private ceremony, though his Al-Gurbaah Foundation has pledged to organise a memorial in the near future to ""honour his immense contributions"". For Teboho Klaas, the religion programme officer at The Other Foundation, which champions LGBTQ+ rights in southern Africa, his killers may have cut his life short ""but not his legacy because he has multiplied himself"".

,,,reliable,,"More than 200 unarmed civilians have been killed in a cluster of villages in Sudan over three days by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that is involved in a brutal conflict with the military, a local rights group has said. The Emergency Lawyers network said the attacks happened in al-Kadaris and al-Khelwat towards the north of White Nile state - areas where the military had no presence. RSF fighters were guilty of ""executions, kidnappings, enforced disappearances and property looting"", the network added. The RSF, which was allied to the military before the civil war broke out in April 2023, has not commented on the allegations. The two had come to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule. Some senior RSF leaders are currently in Kenya where they are expected to announce plans to form their own government in areas under their control. Analysts warn the move could deepen divisions in Sudan. Humanitarians have been sounding the alarm over Sudan, where the conflict has forced about 12 million people from their homes. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, with both the RSF and army accused of committing atrocities. At the heart of this conflict is a falling out between Sudan's de facto ruler and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemedti"" Dagalo, who leads the RSF. The RSF was recently dealt a significant blow when the army regained control of parts of the capital, Khartoum - including its military headquarters. Beyond the capital, the army has also won near total control of the crucial state of Gezira. Following the setbacks, the RSF has rebounded with plans to launch a rival government in areas still under its control, which are mainly in Darfur and parts of Kordofan state. The RSF is meeting allied groups in Nairobi to finalise the adoption of what it calls a ""political charter for the Government of Peace and Unity"". Gen Burhan has rejected the move, and has vowed to reclaim the whole of Khartoum. He is currently based in Port Sudan, having been forced to leave Khartoum months after the civil war broke out when the RSF seized the military headquarters and the presidential palace.

,,,reliable,,"Detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, on hunger strike for a week, has been returned to prison after being in a clinic overnight, his allies have said. The 68-year-old was rushed to a private medical facility in a prison ambulance as his his health was deteriorating, his lawyer Erias Lukwago wrote earlier on Facebook. Besigye was charged in a military court with illegal possession of a firearm, threatening national security, as well as treason, which carries the death sentence. He denies the accusations. The news about his health came hours after a cabinet minister said he had seen Besigye in jail. He urged him to resume eating and pledged to drop his military trial. Another leading opposition politician, Bobi Wine, along with human rights activists, went to the prison on Monday to visit Besigye. But Bobi Wine said that prison officers refused to let them see him as he was very weak. ""This man is actually dying. Dr Besigye is in a terrible state. He cannot leave his bed,"" Bobi Wine told reporters as he called for his release. He added that Besigye's co-accused, Obed Lutale, ""told us that Besigye collapsed this morning when they were trying to carry him out of his bed"". When contacted by the BBC, Uganda Prisons spokesperson Frank Baine refused to comment. ""I said no comment, that is enough,"" he added. Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional. The government had insisted Besigye's military trial would continue and President Museveni dismissed the ruling as ""a wrong decision"", vowing to challenge it. But on Sunday, Information Minister Chris Baryomunsi said he had seen Besigye in prison ""in the presence of his doctors"" and had asked him to end the hunger strike ""as the government fast-tracks the transfer of his case from a court martial to a civil court"". Besigye's wife, Winnie Byanyima, however said the visit was ""highly suspicious"". ""As a government minister, you are not a concerned visitor - you are his captor,"" Ms Byanyima, who is the director of the UN's HIV/Aids programme, posted on X. ""We will hold you and your government fully accountable for any harm that comes to him,"" she added. On Sunday night, a lawmaker allied to the detained politician said Besigye had been taken to a clinic in a suburb of Kampala ""amidst very heavy security deployment"". Francis Mwijukye added Besigye was ""being pushed in a wheel chair"". Wafula Oguttu, a former leader of the opposition in parliament and a Besigye ally, said prison officers around the clinic told him they would take him back to jail after a series of tests had been conducted. Oguttu told the BBC that he had not been allowed to enter the clinic. One of Besigye's political aides, Harold Kaija, said he was now back in prison. Besigye went on hunger strike a week ago to protest against his continued detention by the military, with his trial yet to start. He is a former ally of Museveni - who has been in power since 1986 - and was once his personal doctor. Besigye has previously accused the authorities of political persecution. In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the 2021 election. Besigye appeared before a court on Friday - in a separate case - looking frail. The Ugandan medical doctors' association has since called for his ""immediate release"" on health grounds. There have increasing calls by the family, opposition and human rights groups for Besigye to be released on medical grounds. Additional reporting by the BBC's Swaibu Ibrahim in Kampala.

,,,reliable,,"Police in South Africa are ""hot on the heels"" of the suspects behind the killing of Muhsin Hendricks, dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, Deputy Justice Minister Andries Nel has said. The 57-year-old was in a car when he was shot dead in broad daylight in the coastal city of Gqeberha on Saturday. CCTV footage of the incident shows a hooded figure running out of a pick-up truck that was blocking Hendricks' vehicle and then firing shots through the window. The imam was well known for his work in creating a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims and his killing shocked the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. An investigation is under way but Nel told the Newzroom Afrika TV channel that it was too early to say whether it was a hate crime. Without giving further details, Nel said he was told by Deputy Police Minister Polly Boshielo that officers were tracking down the suspected killers. Paying tribute to Hendricks, Nel said that he ""was a South African that we can all be proud of, a South African that we can all aspire to be"". Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam, which oppose same-sex relations. While being clear that it did not agree with Hendricks, South Africa's Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), one of the country's main religious bodies, condemned the killing. ""As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,"" it said.

,,,reliable,,"The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation. The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people. After a rapid advance in the east, fighters from the M23 rebel group have captured a number of key cities and towns. Their first major coup was at the end of January with the taking of Goma – a city in the North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people. Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub that is within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand. When the rebels took over Goma, UN aid agencies warned of a major humanitarian crisis with shortages of food and water, hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies lying on the streets. The M23 have also seized another key city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu. Other locations now under M23 control include Masisi, Rutshuru and Katale. The rebels previously threatened to continue their offensive to the capital, Kinshasa, although analysts say this may be unlikely, as the city is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country. The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group. They say that several previous deals to end the fighting have not been respected - they take their name from a peace agreement that was signed on 23 March 2009. Shortly after its creation in 2012, the M23 rapidly gained territory and seized Goma – acts that were met with international opprobrium and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations. It was forced to withdraw from Goma, and then suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army along with a UN force that saw it expelled from the country. M23 fighters then agreed to be integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected. But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken. M23 leader Sultani Makenga is a Congolese Tutsi who previously fought in the Rwandan army. Rwanda has in the past consistently denied that it supported the M23, but ever since 2012 UN experts have accused it of providing weapons, logistical support and even ultimately commanding the rebels. DR Congo's government, as well as the US and France, have also identified Rwanda as backing the group. Last year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the M23. On Friday, Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC that the country's troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over to its territory. Rwanda previously said it was being scapegoated and blamed the recent fighting on the Congolese authorities, saying they had refused to enter into a dialogue with the M23. A peace process, mediated by Angola and involving Rwanda and DR Congo, did result in a ceasefire deal last year, however that soon fell apart and fighting resumed. The origin of the current fighting can partly be traced back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. About 800,000 people – the vast majority from the Tutsi community - were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists. The genocide ended with the advance of a force of Tutsi-led rebels commanded by Paul Kagame, who is now president. Fearing reprisals, an estimated one million Hutus then fled across the border to what is now DR Congo. This stoked ethnic tensions as a marginalised Tutsi group in the east – the Banyamulenge – felt increasingly under threat. Rwanda's army twice invaded DR Congo, saying it was going after some of those responsible for the genocide, and worked with members of the Banyamulenge and other armed groups. After 30 years of conflict, one of the Hutu groups, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, is still active in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda describes the FDLR as a ""genocidal militia"" and says its continued existence in the DR Congo's east threatens its own territory. The Rwandan spokesperson said they wanted to return to Rwanda to ""finish the job"". It accuses the Congolese authorities of working with the FDLR - accusations which DR Congo denies. Rwanda is unlikely to stay out of DR Congo unless it is satisfied that the FDLR is no longer a threat to itself, or to the Tutsi communities in eastern DR Congo. DR Congo and multiple UN reports have accused Rwanda of using the conflict as a way of looting Congolese minerals, such as gold and coltan, which is used to make mobile phones and other electronic items such as cameras and inside cars. In recent years, the M23 has seized several lucrative mining areas and a report by UN experts last December said that around 120 tonnes of coltan was being sent by the M23 to Rwanda every four weeks. They also noted a huge rise in Rwanda's mineral exports in recent years, most of which is believed to come from DR Congo. Rwanda has consistently denied allegations of exploiting DR Congo's minerals. A UN peacekeeping mission has been in place since 1999. The current force – known as Monusco – is made up of more than 10,000 troops. However, of these, only the Force Intervention Brigade is allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups. It was this force that helped defeat the M23 in 2013. Monusco has been the target of anger from ordinary Congolese who see it as failing to do its job. President Félix Tshisekedi, deeming the mission a failure, had asked it to leave by the end of last year. But the departure was delayed and in December the mission was extended for another year. The Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional grouping of 16 countries, has also deployed a military force to eastern DR Congo, but it has been unable to halt the rebels. South Africa has said 14 of its soldiers have died in clashes with the M23. Soldiers from the likes of Malawi and Tanzania have also been killed. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, warned Rwanda that further attacks on its troops would be considered a ""declaration of war"". Rwanda's President Paul Kagame hit back, accusing South Africa of being part of a ""belligerent force"" involved in ""offensive combat operations"". The UN said that Uruguay had lost one of its soldiers who was part of the Monusco force. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered Bukavu, the second-largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the regional governor's office. Some people lined the streets to clap and cheer the fighters as they marched and drove into the city centre without resistance. It is the second city after Goma to fall to the rebels in the mineral-rich region in the past few weeks. The Congolese government has acknowledged its fall and urged residents to stay at home ""to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces"". The UN and European countries have warned that the latest offensive, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes, could spark a wider regional war. A resident in Bukavu, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns for her safety, told the BBC on Sunday that most people were still afraid to leave their homes. ""Since yesterday the children and the youth took the weapons. They are shooting everywhere in all directions, they are looting,"" she said. ""This morning the M23 entered and they were acclaimed by the people, very happy to see them. We don't know if it's because they are afraid or because they found that there were no authorities in the city. ""The place where I live the crackling [gunfire] can still be heard."" On Friday, the M23 captured Bukavu's main airport, which is about 30km (18 miles) north of the city - and then began advancing slowly towards the city, which is the capital of South-Kivu province. The provincial governor, Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, confirmed to the Reuters news agency the fighters were in Bukavu city centre by Sunday morning, adding that Congolese troops had withdrawn to avoid urban fighting. This left a security vacuum in the city on Saturday with chaotic scenes playing out, including a reported prison break from the central prison. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said a warehouse with nearly 7,000 tonnes of food was looted. The city of around two million people on the southern tip of Lake Kivu borders Rwanda and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Its fall represents an unprecedented expansion of territory for the M23 since their latest insurgency started in late 2021 - and is a blow to the government of President Félix Tshisekedi. Government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Rwanda was violating DR Congo's territorial integrity through expansionist ambitions and human rights abuses. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region - as well as having troops on the ground - so it can benefit from its natural resources, something Kigali denies. President Tshisekedi wants his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to face sanctions over the latest unrest. But President Kagame has dismissed such threats - and has repeatedly pointed out that Rwanda's main priority is its security. He has long been angered by what he sees as the failure of the Congolese authorities to deal with the DR Congo-based FLDR rebel group, which he sees as a danger to Rwanda. The group is made up of some members of the ethnic Hutu militia accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when over 100 days around 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group, were killed. Troops from the Tusti-led M23 gathered at the Place de l'Indépendance in central Bukavu on Sunday, where one of its commanders, Bernard Byamungu, was filmed chatting to locals and answering their questions in Swahili. He urged government forces ""hiding in houses"" to surrender - and accused the withdrawing military of spreading terror by arming local youths who had gone on a looting rampage. The African Union (AU) - which has been holding a heads of state summit in Ethiopia this weekend - again urged the M23 to disarm. ""We are all very, very concerned about an open regional war,"" Reuters quotes the AU's peace and security commissioner Bankole Adeo as saying.

,,,reliable,,"More than 40 people, mostly women, were killed after an illegal gold mine collapsed in Mali on Saturday. The collapse took place near Kéniéba, in Mali's western, gold-rich Kayes region. The victims had climbed into open-pit areas left by industrial miners to look for scraps of gold when the earth around them caved in, a gold miner's union leader told Reuters. This is Mali's second deadly mining accident in three weeks, after at least 10 people were killed when a mining tunnel flooded late in January. There are conflicting reports on the number people who died in Saturday's accident. A local police source told the AFP news agency that 48 people were killed in the collapse, while the head of an industry union told Reuters there were 43 victims. ""Some of the victims fell into the water. Among them was a woman with her baby on her back,"" the local police source told AFP. Rescue workers have been able to retrieve the bodies, local sources told the BBC. Mali is one of the biggest gold producers in the world. Accidents are common in the country as much mining activity is unregulated, with miners using unsafe methods to dig for gold. Just over a year ago, at least 40 people were killed after a tunnel collapsed in a mine. It is also common for illegal miners - mostly women - to try to recover gold from abandoned sites due to poverty. A spokesperson from the country's mines ministry confirmed to Reuters that the accident had taken place between the towns of Kéniéba and Dabia, but declined to give further details. Ministry teams are drawing up a report at the scene, Reuters reports. The collapse on Saturday occurred at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, according to AFP. Beijing is heavily invested in developing Mali's mining industries, with the approval of its government. Since Mali is rich in natural resources, including gold, iron ore, manganese, lithium, and uranium, it is an attractive destination for Chinese investors. While such investment has improved Mali's infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector, the government has accumulated significant debt obligations to China, raising concerns about its ability to repay the loans. Chinese mining activities have also been criticised for contributing to environmental pollution in the country. Mali is currently engaged in a dispute over revenue sharing with one of the largest mining companies in the country, the Canadian firm Barrick. Last month, the Malian government seized gold bars worth $245m (£194m) from Barrick and issued an arrest warrant for its CEO, Mark Bristow. Mr Bristow said he had ""no doubt"" the conflict would be resolved in an interview with Bloomberg this week. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"Muhsin Hendricks, a pioneering figure dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, has been shot dead in South Africa. The 57-year-old cleric ran a mosque in Cape Town intended as a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims. He was killed on Saturday morning after the car in which he was travelling near the southern city of Gqeberha was ambushed. ""Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle,"" police said in a statement. News of Hendricks' death has sent shockwaves through the LGBTQ+ community and beyond, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across the globe. Julia Ehrt, executive director at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga), called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate ""what we fear may be a hate crime"". ""He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith, and his life has been a testament to the healing that solidarity across communities can bring in everyone's lives,"" she said. Hendricks was killed after he had reportedly officiated at a lesbian wedding, though this has not been officially confirmed. The details of the attack emerged through security footage that was shared on social media. It shows a car pulling up and blocking the vehicle in which Hendricks was travelling as it was pulling away from the curb. According to police, the imam was in the back seat. The angle of CCTV footage reveals what happened from one side of the road - an assailant jumps out of a car, runs to the ambushed vehicle and shoots repeatedly through the back passenger window. Hendricks' Al-Ghurbaah Foundation, which runs the Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town, confirmed he had died in a targeted attack on Saturday morning. But Abdulmugheeth Petersen, chair of the foundation's board, appealed via a WhatsApp group for their followers to be patient, stressing the importance of protecting Hendricks' family. Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam and championed a compassionate, inclusive faith. South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.

,,,reliable,,"With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms. All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it. The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; £4m) for those found to have killed one. Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity. It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died. ""Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,"" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC. But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them. ""I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,"" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC. Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard. ""We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,"" she told the BBC. Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather. Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates. But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home. ""In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,"" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC. In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda. This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012. ""Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,"" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC. Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara. Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda. ""One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,"" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC. Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes. Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides. ""I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,"" he told the BBC. However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible. ""It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,"" he told the BBC. Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles. Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment. ""Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,"" Ms Kugonza told BBC. Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi. But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful. ""It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,"" said Mr Muheebwa. They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it. Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days. Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns. Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck. ""Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,"" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said. This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes. And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands. President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation. The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected. Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained ""very low"". For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law. ""We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,"" he said.

,,,reliable,,"Chaotic scenes have been unfolding in Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as the M23 rebel group continues its offensive in the region. On Saturday there were reports of sporadic gunfire and widespread looting in the city, including at a World Food Programme depot, with residents sheltering in their homes. It follows conflicting reports about whether the Rwanda-backed rebels had entered the key city of Bukavu, after advances in the region. On Friday M23 fighters seized Kavumu airport, north of Bukavu. The UN and the European Union have voiced alarm over the worsening conflict. A threat by Uganda's army chief to attack a Congolese town has sparked fears the conflict could flare into a wider regional war. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told an African Union summit on Saturday a regional escalation must be avoided ""at all costs"" and there was ""no military solution"". ""And the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected,"" Guterres continued. The European Union said it was ""urgently"" considering all options following the news from Bukavu. ""The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered,"" it warned. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its natural resources - a claim Rwanda has denied. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance. On Saturday, the streets of Bukavu were deserted as residents hid in their homes. One woman in the city told the BBC people were avoiding going outside as gunfire rang out and youths looted and destroyed shops. ""I only have enough food for three days. As a woman it is difficult for me to go outside because I could be raped [by the looters or the armed groups]. We feel abandoned by the authorities."" The looting included the World Food Programme's depot in Bukavu, which housed 6,800 metric tons of food, a spokesman for the UN aid agency told the Reuters news agency. Claude Kalinga said the stealing of supplies would deepen the difficulties faced by those in need. The agency had already suspended its activities for weeks due to the deteriorating security situation. There have been conflicting reports over whether M23 fighters have entered Bukavu, as the group claims, and to what extent. Two residents of the northern Bukavu suburb of Bagira said they had seen rebels on the streets and no sign of fighting. However, an M23 source, two Congolese army officers and multiple Bukavu residents, on Saturday told Reuters that the rebels had not yet entered the city centre. The capture of Bukavu, a city estimated to have an urban population of more than a million people, would represent an unprecedented expansion of territory under the M23's control since the latest insurgency started in 2022. Bukavu, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Meanwhile, on Saturday, the chief of Uganda's defence forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a post on X he would attack the town of Bunia, also in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, unless ""all forces"" there surrendered their arms within 24 hours, igniting fears of a wider conflict. The threat by Kainerugaba, whose father is the president of Uganda, adds to fears that the region risks slipping back into a broader war reminiscent of conflicts in the 1990s and 2000s which killed millions. Uganda's military since 2021 has supported the Congolese army in its fight against Islamist militants in the east, but UN experts say Uganda has also backed the M23 group. The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people.",,,,Gunfire and looting in DR Congo city as rebels advance,"Alex Therrien, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"M23 rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have entered Bukavu, the eastern region's second-largest city. Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance which includes M23 rebels, told Reuters news agency the rebels had entered the South Kivu provincial capital on Friday evening and would continue their advance on Saturday. The Rwandan-backed militants' progress comes despite international calls for a ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance. Last month, the Tutsi-led M23, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, seized Goma, the main city in the mineral-rich east. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied. The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region. The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance. But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC. In a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports. A local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report. Residents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having ""expansionist ambitions"", the AFP news agency reports. ""We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos,"" he is quoted as saying. As well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security. He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions. The news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday. The head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire ""must be observed"" adding that ""military campaigns are not going to solve these problems.

,,,reliable,,"Liberian President Joseph Boakai has suspended more than 450 top government officials for failing to declare their assets to the anti-corruption agency. They will be off work without pay for a month or ""until they submit the required declarations"", according to the presidency. Boakai said that the officials had contravened the code of conduct for state officials by not being transparent about what they own. The president, who had pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability. The law requires all public officers to declare their wealth before taking up their posts and when they leave positions in government. The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) published the list of all the 457 affected public officials, noting it was doing so as prescribed by law. Boakai, who pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability. ""Public officials are reminded that asset declaration is not only a legal obligation but also a fundamental measure to promote transparency and restore public trust in governmental institution,"" he said in a statement. Last July, the president announced that he was reducing his salary by 40%, saying he hoped to set a precedent for ""responsible governance"" and demonstrate ""solidarity"" with Liberians. The government of his predecessor, George Weah, had faced accusations of corruption and lavish spending, sparking mass protests amid a rise in the cost of living. On Wednesday, some of the suspended officials visited the anti-corruption commission offices in order to comply with the requirement. There has been mixed reaction over the president's move. Political analyst Abdullah Kiatamba was quoted by Liberian newspaper FrontPage Africa as being supportive of the president's anti-corruption stance, but raised concerns about the challenges some officials faced in submitting their asset declarations. Civil society group Solidarity and Trust for a New Day described Boakai's move as insufficient.

,,,reliable,,"A popular Congalese musician has been killed while filming a music video in Goma, which was overrun by M23 militants, after releasing a song condemning the rebel occupation of the city. The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, better known as Delcat Idengo, was found in a street on Thursday with his head partially covered with blood. Unconfirmed reports say the artist was shot. Idengo, who was a critic of all sides in the conflict, was among hundreds of inmates who escaped from a prison in Goma, after the militants seized the city last month. The east of DR Congo has been engulfed in fighting as armed groups and the army battle it out for control of the mineral-rich region. It is not clear who was behind the killing. ""Justice will be done,"" government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya posted on X platform, terming the musician's killing an ""abominable act"". He blamed the M23. But the M23 pointed the finger at government-aligned forces, calling on them to hand over their weapons. The killing comes amid growing tension in the area after the Rwanda-backed M23 captured Goma, in a major escalation of the fighting in late January. Around 2,900 people have been killed and about 700,000 others forced from their homes in the recent hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest. The rebels are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu - another key city in the region - despite regional peace efforts to end the conflict. Idengo's death has sparked fresh fears in North Kivu as protesters took to the streets of Beni, where he was born, to demand justice. Videos shared on social media showed the musician's body lying on the ground after the incident in the Kilijiwe area, in the north of Goma. According to the witnesses, Idengo, who was wearing military trousers for the video, died on the spot after the attack. The Congolese ministry of arts and culture described the incident as an ""assassination"". ""A committed voice, he carried, through his music, the aspirations and hopes of an entire generation,"" the ministry posted on X. Idengo was awaiting trail after his jailing last year for inciting people to take up arms and force UN peacekeepers to leave the country. In 2021, he was prosecuted for insulting President Félix Tshisekedi and spreading ""false rumours"" in one of his songs where he accused the president of not fulfilling his promises. He was sentenced to 10 years, but was later acquitted. ""The nation has lost a patriot committed to national cohesion. I mourn the loss of Idengo. It is high time for this war to end. Humanity above all!"" Martin Fayulu, an opposition leader who came third in the 2023 general election, posted on X.

Ofori-Atta had left Ghana to evade investigations, and all necessary steps would be taken to bring him back, Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyabeng said. Ofori-Atta has been accused of causing financial losses to the state, including over a controversial national cathedral, which remains a hole in the ground despite the alleged spending of $58m (£46.6m) of government money. Ofori-Atta has not commented on the allegations. According to Agyabeng, the ex-minister's lawyers said he was out of the country for medical reasons. Agyabeng told a press conference that Ofori-Atta, 66, failed to attend an interview with the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), despite being told he was a suspect. Ofori-Atta left Ghana in early January, and had no intention of ""willingly"" returning, Agyabeng said. The OSP was, therefore, declaring him a ""wanted person"". ""He is a fugitive from justice,"" the special prosecutor added. Ofori-Atta was finance minister from January 2017 to February 2024, when the New Patriotic Party (NPP) was in power. It lost elections in December to the National Democratic Congress (NDC). President John Mahama, who was inaugurated in January, went on to establish an investigative committee known as Operation Recover All Loot. The committee has received over 200 complaints of corruption, amounting to more than $20bn in recoverable funds.

,,,reliable,,"A paramilitary force in Sudan has stormed the country's largest displacement camp, looting and setting fire to the market and several homes, a local refugee group has said. The Zamzam camp in North Darfur has been hit by intense artillery shelling since late last year, but this is the first time the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been accused of sending in fighters. An eyewitness told the BBC the situation at the camp was ""extremely catastrophic"", and there were many casualties. The nearby city of el-Fasher, one of the centres of the civil war that erupted in 2023, is already under siege by the RSF as it battles the army. The military and RSF had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule. The Sudanese IDPs and Refugees Bloc said Zamzam camp was invaded on Tuesday. However, an RSF spokesman denied its fighters had penetrated it, saying they had seized a nearby military base belonging to an armed group that fights alongside the Sudanese military, after it had shelled RSF checkpoints for days. BBC Verify has confirmed social media footage that shows men waving guns triumphantly with flames behind them and saying they are in the camp. The insignia has been removed from their uniforms, but the man filming the video has RSF markings. Asked about the damage to the market the RSF spokesman said the group had ""circulated a message in which we committed to protect the camp residents and asked them to stay away from the fire exchange areas"". Zamzam hosts about half a million displaced people who were already suffering from famine. Reports said the attack forced thousands of them to flee again. Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs a hospital in Zamzam, said it had received seven dead bodies and 21 injured people at the hospital it runs in Zamzam. Most of them were in a serious condition, but the hospital lacked the ability to care for all of them, an MSF spokesperson added. The eyewitness the BBC spoke to said the hospital no longer had a functioning surgery. North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Abdullah Khater told the BBC that the wounded were not able to reach el-Fasher for treatment because the RSF was blocking the road and preventing access to the city. ""The ones suffering the most are the displaced people,"" he said. The humanitarian catastrophe worsened late last year when Zamzam came under heavy artillery fire, which aid organisations, including MSF, blamed on the RSF. A group of international non-governmental organisations issued a statement in December, saying the attacks on Zamzam marked ""an escalation in violence on a site which has previously been spared from active hostilities"", although it was ""consistent with a pattern of attacks"" on other camps for displaced people. ""This underscores the reality that there are now no safe places for people to flee to in North Darfur,"" it said. The siege of el-Fasher began last April - a year into the conflict. It is the only city still under army control in Darfur, where the RSF has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities.

,,,reliable,,"A pause in US foreign aid has ""severely impacted"" humanitarian efforts in conflict-hit Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior UN official in the country has said. Bruno Lemarquis told reporters that DR Congo was the largest recipient of US humanitarian assistance last year - 70% of the African country's aid had come from Washington. US President Donald Trump's decision to pause all international aid was, therefore, a ""major source of concern"", Mr Lemarquis said. The suspension comes as intense clashes between the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group and DR Congo's army worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis. Approximately 700,000 people are said to have been forced from their homes since the fighting escalated last month. In Goma, a city captured by the M23 last month, residents told the BBC of damaged livelihoods and hospitals overwhelmed by those injured in conflict. The risk of epidemics such as cholera and mpox were also high in Goma, Mr Lemarquis said during Tuesday's briefing. He added that an increased number of residents needed food aid as prices had risen, but the US pause on foreign aid hindered agencies from tackling these issues. ""Our ultra dependence on US funding means a lot of programmes had to shut down on everything we are doing. So, it's emergency health, it is emergency shelter."" Mr Lemarquis said. President Trump froze all foreign assistance provided by the United States, by far the world's biggest aid donor, on his first day back in office, calling for a review to ensure it abided by his ""America First"" foreign policy. Trump's administration has targeted the government's main overseas aid agency, USAID, saying its spending is totally unexplainable. The dramatic suspension of humanitarian assistance has hit programmes across the world - one veteran humanitarian worker told the BBC the pause was ""like an earthquake across the aid sector"". Pepfar, a ground-breaking US programme countering the global spread of HIV, is among those that have been heavily impacted. ""The program is shuttered…. Services are shut,"" Dr Atul Gawande, the former Assistant Administrator for Global Health at USAID, told the BBC last month. He said clinics that served 20 million people with HIV were affected. And in Syria, water, sanitation and security services were all upended at the al-Hol displacement camp following Trump's directive. Critical services have also been hit in Afghanistan, a country whose health sector receives a huge portion of its funding from the US. A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there told the BBC that more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused. ""If the funding halt continues, mothers will be forced to give birth at home as the facilities are closed and it will increase mortality rates,"" one midwife said.

,,,reliable,,"Nigerians are expressing outrage over a big jump in the price of mobile data charged by some of the country's major phone networks. MTN - Nigeria's largest operator - trebled the cost of one of its most popular weekly offers. Airtel has also increased its tariffs. A price jump was expected as the telecoms regulatory body had approved an increase, but in an announcement three weeks ago it said it had capped it at 50%. The phone companies wanted to boost their revenue in order to cover rising costs. Nigerians have been living through a long cost-of-living crisis with inflation rates not seen for three decades. Any increase in prices adds to the struggle for many to make ends meet. In response to customer complaints, MTN said on X that the price adjustment was necessary to serve subscribers better. ""We apologize for any inconvenience caused,” the company added. Airtel is yet to comment. Subscribers only realised what had happened when they went to buy data over the past few hours. The BBC has contacted Airtel for more information on the changes. Many comments on social media called out the increase saying that it could cut off a lot of people at a time when the economy is in turmoil. One target for criticism has been the rise in MTN's 15GB weekly bundle from 2,000 naira ($1.33; £1.08) to 6,000 naira ($3.99). ""What sort of outrageous increase is that?... Just making sure the masses suffer more,"" one commenter on X said. ""Triple the amount? The end time is near,"" another wrote. Subscribers are also complaining that MTN's 1GB bundle has more than doubled in price and Airtel has trebled the cost of a similar offer. People who use Globacom - the third largest network - say they have not been affected by increases. The Nigeria Communications Commission, which regulates the telecom companies, is yet to react to the price rises which in some cases appear to exceed the cap that it had recommended. Digital content creator Mubarak Uniquepikin told the BBC that the tariff hike could have a major impact for businesses that depend on being online. ""The economy is already comatose and for this to come in now when a lot of people can't rent shops and have taken their business online is bad,"" he said. ""Many young people already find it difficult to buy data and this would definitely make it worse for them."" Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. A rise in inflation caused by the war in Ukraine was exacerbated when in 2023 President Bola Tinubu's government dropped the fuel subsidy.

The dismissals were announced in a series of presidential decrees read on the state broadcaster. No reasons were given for the move. South Sudan has five vice-presidents as part of a 2018 peace agreement to end a civil war. The oil-rich nation became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan - but it was then engulfed by civil war after Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar fell out. The 2018 power-sharing agreement has been fraught with problems. One of the vice-president removed from office is James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general, who has been in the position since 2013 and has been the deputy chair of SPLM, the party of the president. The other is Hussein Abdelbagi Akol, from an opposition alliance (SSOA) which is not part of the main opposition movement (SPLM-In Opposition) of First Vice-President Riek Machar. Akol has been appointed the minister for agriculture, replacing Josephine Joseph Lagu from the same SSOA alliance who now becomes a vice-president. Benjamin Bol Mel, who was sanctioned by the US in 2017 for alleged corruption, has been appointed to replace Igga as vice-president. Mel, previously a special presidential envoy for special programmes, has been the subject of speculation that he was being fronted as a potential successor of Kiir. The president has not appointed replacements for the health minister and the governor of the south-western state of Western Equatoria, who are both from Machar's party. He has also not appointed a substantive replacement for the sacked spy chief, Akec Tong Aleu, who had only served four months after having been appointed in October. The 2018 peace deal gives the president prerogative to appoint and dismiss government officials at both national and state level. He can only appoint and dismiss officials who belong to other political parties with the consent of the leadership of those parties. It is not clear whether the dismissal of Western Equatoria governor and the health minister were recommended by their party leader, Machar. The SPLM-In Opposition has not commented on the matter. South Sudan has not conducted an election since independence. The first nationwide vote was scheduled to take place in 2015, but the election could not go ahead due to the conflict that erupted in December 2013. It was then supposed to happen in 2022, but polls were postponed for two years and were due two months ago. The vote was postponed again, and the country's leadership said the election will now take place in December 2026. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

,,,reliable,,"South Africa's first black female nuclear scientist, Senamile Masango, a trailblazer who set out to inspire young women, has died aged 37, the government has confirmed. Ms Masango, dubbed ""the queen of science"" by some in South Africa, passed away on Sunday. The cause of her death is unknown. Headstrong and ambitious, she ""was a beacon of hope for many young people, especially women"", a statement from Deputy President Paul Mashatile said. Despite her success she said she faced discrimination as a black woman as she constantly had to prove that she knew what she was talking about. Nevertheless, her unwavering determination earned her deep respect in her field. Ms Masango was the first African woman to join an African-led team conducting experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. ""Masango's tireless efforts to promote science education and empowerment, particularly among women and disadvantaged communities, will be deeply missed,"" a statement from South Africa's Department of Science, Technology and Innovation said. Born in 1987 in the rural village of Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, the historical seat of the Zulu monarchy, Ms Masango's mother was a princess in the royal family, and her father was a prominent figure. She grew up in a polygamous family, with her mother being the youngest of three wives. It was a challenging family set-up, she told local newspaper Sowetan Live, but she learned how to stand up for herself. Her parents quickly recognised her early passion for learning and encouraged her to read extensively. At 11, her geography teacher spoke about astronauts, sparking a lifelong interest in science. ""I was so fascinated to learn that there are people who travel to space - leave this dimension - and go to the moon,"" she told Global Citizen, an organisation dedicated to ending extreme poverty. ""That's when I fell in love with science."" Ms Masango enrolled at the University of Zululand at 16 to study physics, but after becoming pregnant and failing some modules, she had to drop out. With her family's support, she returned to complete her degree and later earned an MSc in nuclear physics at the University of the Western Cape, graduating with distinction. Tragically, her daughter died in a car crash aged seven. Beyond her academic accomplishments, Ms Masango established a foundation dedicated to encouraging young women to pursue science. ""Girls are discouraged at an early age from taking science subjects; it is the root cause of the lack of women in the nuclear space,"" she said. Her remarkable achievements included being named one of South Africa's most successful black women scientists under 35 in 2019 and earning a spot on the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans in Science and Technology list. In 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community. But throughout her career, Ms Masango faced misogynoir - the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender. ""The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think!"" ""There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,"" she said. Yet, she persevered, using her journey to help inspire a new generation to pursue science fearlessly and boldly.

,,,reliable,,"The Sudanese military has called for diplomatic support for a new government that it says it wants to form after it recaptures the capital, Khartoum, from rival forces. The Sudanese army has been regaining control of areas in the city previously held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in recent weeks. Army leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan told a meeting of politicians who back the army over the weekend that he would form a ""technocratic"" wartime government with a prime minister. He insisted there would be no negotiations with the RSF. The two sides have been fighting for approaching two years - a conflict that has forced 12 million from their homes and left many starving. Gen Burhan also said there would be a new constitution prior to the formation of the transitional government. ""We can call it a caretaker government, a wartime government, but it's a government that will help us complete what remains of our military objectives, which is freeing Sudan from these rebels,"" he said on Saturday. A statement by the foreign ministry on Sunday called on ""the international community, particularly the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League, to support the roadmap presented by the state as a national consensus for establishing peace and stability and completing the tasks of the transition"". The army and the RSF, which once worked together, have since been involved in a vicious power struggle. The ongoing war, in which tens of thousands have been killed, broke out in April 2023 after Gen Burhan and RSF head Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo fell out over the future shape of the government. The conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, according to international aid agencies. Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, the RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in the Darfur area. Both forces deny the accusations. In recent weeks, the army has had huge victories against the RSF in the capital and Gezira state. The paramilitary force has retreated from these areas overpowered by the army's expanded air power as well as ground support by allied militias.

,,,reliable,,"The Democratic Republic of Congo is in turmoil - fighters from the notorious M23 rebel group have been surging through the country's east, battling the national army and capturing key places as they go. In just a fortnight, thousands of people are said to have been killed and the fighting has sparked an ominous war of words between DR Congo and its neighbour, Rwanda. So how did DR Congo - the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa - get here? The origins of this complex conflict can be understood through the story of one man - M23 leader Sultani Makenga, who is the subject of various war crime allegations. He is sanctioned by the US of using child soldiers, which he has denied. The UN has accused him of being responsible for sexual violence. To go back through Makenga's life so far is to look into decades of warfare, intermittent foreign intervention and the persistent lure of DR Congo's rich mineral resources. His life began on Christmas Day in 1973, when he was born in the lush Congolese town of Masisi. Raised by parents of the Tutsi ethnic group, Makenga quit school at the age of 17 to join a Tutsi rebel outfit across the border in Rwanda. This group, named the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), were demanding greater Tutsi representation in Rwanda's government, which at the time was dominated by politicians from the Hutu majority. They also wanted the hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees who had been forced from the country by ethnic violence to be able to return home. For four years, Makenga and the RPF fought the Hutu-dominated army in Rwanda.

The grave was discovered north of Kufra, just days after another mass grave with 19 bodies was found on a farm in the same city. Officials found the latest grave following a raid on a human trafficking site, where authorities freed 76 migrants who had been detained and tortured, the office of the attorney general posted on Facebook.

Eighteen American soldiers lost their lives in the fighting that began on 3 October, but so did hundreds of Somalis. As Netflix launches a documentary about those events, the BBC has spoken to some Somalis still scarred by what happened. Despite being surrounded by the debris of an ongoing civil war, Mogadishu's residents in the early 1990s embraced the moments of serenity.

They were there to support a UN mission that offered humanitarian assistance to alleviate a famine – in part caused by the collapse of the central government. But after Aideed was blamed for being behind the killing of 24 UN peacekeepers in June 1993, he became a focus of military action. This included a US raid in July in which at least 70 Somalis died, marking a turning-point in the way the Americans were viewed. It also led to the deployment of elite US Rangers. On 3 October, the US got intelligence that Aideed would be at a meeting with his top officials at a hotel.

,,,reliable,,"Revered as ""father of the nation"" and the icon of Namibia's liberation struggle, Sam Nujoma lived up to these expectations in more ways than one. His warm, broad smile and easy-going manner made him likeable and accessible. Whether donning a tracksuit to join a fun-run along Windhoek's Independence Avenue, or insisting his driver hang back from official motorcades, he aimed to be a man of the people. Now, four decades after leading Namibia through a bitter guerrilla war against South Africa's racist apartheid government and on to independence, Nujoma has died aged 95. He died on Saturday after being in hospital for three weeks due to ""ill health"", President Nangolo Mbumba announced in a statement, adding that the death had ""shaken"" the country. The giant who shaped Namibia's national identity leaves a void few can hope to fill. Namibia, previously called South West Africa, suffered decades of looting and colonial violence at the hands of Europeans who had flocked to the country around the turn of the 20th Century. Starting in 1904, German colonisers killed tens of thousands of Namibians in what has been dubbed the world's ""forgotten genocide"". German officers used black Africans as guinea pigs for horrific crimes later repeated by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Namibia was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One. Namibia then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms. The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966. By this stage, Nujoma was already involved in the fight against white-minority rule. The self-confessed ""elder son of a peasant family"" from the northern village of Etunda had a modest start in life, with little more than a primary school education. Married to Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune with whom he had four children, and working on a railway, he held a deep passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism. Inspiration came in the stories of early Namibian resistance leaders, such as Hendrik Witbooi, who fought against the Germans in the 1880s. By 1959, Nujoma had become the head of the Owamboland Peoples organisation, the independence movement that was a forerunner to Swapo. A year later, aged 30, Nujoma was forced into exile. With no passport, he used his cunning to adopt different personas and blagged his way onto trains and planes - ending up in Zambia and Tanzania before heading to West Africa. With the help of Liberian authorities who were early backers of black Namibians' push for independence, Nujoma flew to New York and petitioned the UN to help grant Namibia its independence - but South Africa refused. Nujoma was branded a ""Marxist terrorist"" by South Africa's white leaders for leading forces that fought alongside the anti-apartheid movement, posing a formidable challenge to the oppressive regimes in several southern African countries. With support from Cuban troops who were fighting in neighbouring Angola, Swapo guerrillas were able to attack South African bases in Namibia. Returning from exile, Nujoma was swiftly rearrested by the South African authorities and deported to Zambia six years later. ""We knew that only military force and mass political mobilisation backed by the support of the people would force South Africa out of Namibia,"" Nujoma narrated in his autobiography Where Others Wavered, which was published in 2001. He led Swapo forces from exile, before returning to the country in 1989, a year after South Africa had agreed to Namibian independence. South Africa was becoming more isolated internationally and the cost of military intervention was increasing. Namibia finally gained independence in 1990 after almost 25 years of warfare. In Namibia's first democratic elections in 1990, Swapo won a huge majority and Nujoma became the country's first president. Nujoma was especially concerned with the plight of children, introducing maintenance payments obliging absent fathers to contribute to the cost of raising their offspring. He also championed the advancement of women, helping to change traditional patriarchal practices that forced widows out of the family home once their husband died. He also appeared keen to preserve stability to ensure development efforts were supported by international donors. Nujoma was re-elected for two more terms in 1994 and 1999 - when he was criticised for having the constitution changed so that he could stand for a third term in office. When criticised for his style of government or questioned about his party's political past, the wide smile could turn sour. Pointing a finger at whoever dared openly question or criticise, he would sometimes lose his countenance and hurl insults. He openly abhorred same-sex relationships, but never went as far as changing the constitution or the law to make them illegal. Nujoma always valued his close friendship with Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, yet as Namibia's president he mostly steered clear of open aggression against those who did not agree with him. However through the Swapo machinery, he would quite happily exert pressure on the common man to tow the party line and allow the party to delve into government coffers to ensure continued rule. Nujoma's cabinet was often dictated to rather than reaching decisions by joint debate, such was his power. When he stepped down as president in 2005 and as Swapo president in 2007 after serving as the party leader for 47 years – he handed power to his successor, Hifikepunye Pohamba. Even after leaving office, Nujoma still wielded considerable power over the party and government from behind the scenes. Yet his achievements while in office are undeniable, with many Namibians praising him for leading the country's smooth transition to democratic rule. Since independence, Namibia has been seen as one of Africa's success stories, with regular peaceful and democratic elections. And, despite the humiliations and injustices heaped upon black Namibians by white colonisers, Nujoma upheld the country's constitution in safeguarding the basic rights of all Namibians whatever their ethnicity. The policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other economic sectors. Nujoma's ability to unify a nation of three million people – across 10 ethnic and linguistic communities – won him many admirers. In recognition of his towering achievement, the Namibian parliament granted him the official status of ""Founding Father of Namibia"" in 2005. Numerous international honours included the Lenin Peace Prize, the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize and the Ho Chi Minh Peace Prize. In his latter years, Nujoma disappeared from the limelight, preferring instead to spend time with his large family. He is remembered for his easy charm and unwavering conviction - father not just to a family but a whole nation.

,,,reliable,,"Leaders from east and southern Africa have called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end the deadly fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo. At a crisis summit in Tanzania, the Southern African Development Community and East African Community (EAC) blocs urged all warring parties to hold peace talks within five days, including with the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The rebels - fighting government forces - have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the city of Goma. Their push towards Bukavu has raised fears of a wider regional war. As part of their talks, army chiefs have also been told to draw up a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas. The latest UN figures suggest 2,900 people have been killed since early January, as a result of the hostilities between M23 and armed forces of the DR Congo. Around 700,000 are estimated to have been displaced and thousands more injured. Saturday's gathering in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's biggest city, brought together heads of state and government representatives to try to resolve the worsening security and humanitarian situation. ""The summit emphasises that political and diplomatic engagement is the most sustainable solution to the conflict,"" said the follow-up communique. It also demanded the reopening of Goma airport and other key routes to facilitate humanitarian aid, as well as the withdrawal of uninvited foreign armed forces from Congolese territory. M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth. Rwandan President Paul Kagame - who was at the summit - has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the rebels. But, as reported last month by the BBC's Ian Wafula, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in ""de facto control of M23 operations"" - detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry. Following the summit, Kagame posted on Facebook, accusing the DR Congo of ""mounting a security problem against our country"". The DR Congo's President, Félix Tshisekedi, opted to appear at the summit via video link. Prime Minister Judith Suminwa was there in person. There was no immediate response from Suminwa or the Congolese delegation to the joint communique. Kenyan President William Ruto, the current EAC chairperson, stressed military solutions alone could not resolve the crisis. ""We must resist the temptation to think that we can somehow shoot or bombard our way into a solution in the face of such a complex situation,"" he said. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan underscored a ""collective responsibility"" of regional leaders to end the conflict, saying ""history will judge us harshly if we remain still and watch the situation worsen day by day"".

,,,reliable,,"The seizure by M23 rebels of vast tracts of land in the mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has triggered a humanitarian and diplomatic crisis, involving several neighbouring countries. An alarming number of African armies already have troops deployed in the conflict zone, which has a long history of outside interference. The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs. The two regional groupings are joining forces to hold an emergency summit on Saturday to try and end the fighting. So, who are the main players and what do they want? First and foremost is the Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi. He wants to regain territory lost to the rebels, including the largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent them from seizing more. He blames Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing the M23 with weapons and troops, accusing Kigali of invading Congolese territory with the aim of looting the country's mineral wealth and orchestrating regime change. The case that Rwanda is supporting the M23 offensive is based on evidence presented in a UN report and broadly accepted by many African and Western governments, who have demanded that Kagame withdraw his forces. However, to Tshisikedi's frustration, none have matched their rhetoric with action and responded to Kinshasa's calls for sanctions and other tough measures. The Congolese leader is also worried about keeping his seat. ""I think the political survival of his government is at stake,"" said Jason Stearns, a former UN investigator in DR Congo and currently a professor at Simon Fraser University. There is concern that the M23 campaign might embolden internal opposition forces or trigger a coup in his army, which has a reputation for being fragmented and undermined by corruption. In this conflict, Rwanda's long-time leader Kagame is the centre of attention, but he's practised at deflecting it. He has a long history of military intervention inside DR Congo linked to the aftermath of the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Rwanda does not admit to providing military support to the M23, but repeatedly insists it will do anything necessary to defend itself. Kagame maintains that Rwanda's priority is to destroy an armed group formed by the Hutu genocide perpetrators, who massacred Rwandan Tutsis and then fled to what is now eastern DR Congo. He has accused DR Congo's army of joining forces with them and others to not only slaughter Congolese Tutsis - who the M23 claims to be fighting to protect - but to threaten Rwanda. At a diplomatic level, Rwanda wants confirmation of its narrative – that the conflict is a Congolese problem, and Kigali is simply defending its borders against the spill-over of a civil war. It's demanding that Kinshasa negotiate directly with the M23, which it refuses to do. But what it's really after, said Mr Stearns, is ""to maintain a sphere of influence in the eastern DR Congo"". Rwanda has economic as well as security interests. Kigali denies UN evidence that it smuggles vast amounts of gold and other metals out of eastern DR Congo and sells them as its own. But access to DR Congo's mineral wealth has been a driver of conflict in the region for decades. There are others this time around, not least the personal animosity between Kagame and Tshisekedi. ""Kagame wants to teach Tshisekedi a lesson about who's the strong guy on the block,"" said Richard Moncrieff, who monitors Africa's Great Lakes region for the International Crisis Group (ICG). The Rwandans are ""just going to keep fighting until he makes concessions and…gives them fairly free rein in [the eastern province of] North Kivu,"" he added. Rwanda sees Burundi's army as another security threat in eastern DR Congo. The nation that borders both Rwanda and DR Congo has had thousands of soldiers there for years. They went to hunt down Burundian rebels but are now supporting Kinshasa's army in battles against the M23. Relations between Rwanda and Burundi are hostile. The two countries have a similar ethnic make-up but unlike Rwanda, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi. Both countries have accused each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments. Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye has posted a strongly-worded warning on social media. ""If Rwanda continues to make conquests,"" he wrote, ""I know that war will even arrive in Burundi… One day he [Kagame] wants to come to Burundi - we're not going to accept that. The war will spread."" The threat would increase if the M23 continues its advance from Goma into the province of South Kivu closer to Burundi's border, which is where its forces are stationed. ""What Burundi is seeking here is regime survival,"" said Mr Stearns. ""Burundi is worried that if Rwandan troops… extend their influence into South Kivu that could destabilize the government in Bujumbura. What's at stake here is stopping this rebellion before it gets too close to home."" Some fear a repeat of the two wars that engulfed the region in the late 1990s, which drew in nine different countries and reportedly led to millions of deaths. This time, direct clashes between the two armies could extend the DR Congo's conflict beyond its borders. Uganda is not directly involved, but it also has troops in eastern DR Congo. They are helping the Congolese government with a different security threat – hunting down militants with Ugandan origins who are connected to the Islamic State group. But Uganda's role is confusing – it's working with the Congolese, while also allegedly providing at least complicit support to the M23. UN experts report that it has allowed them to use Ugandan territory as a rear base and supply route. Kampala strongly denies that. But it has responded to the M23 offensive by putting its troops in a ""forward defensive posture,"" to prevent other armed groups from exploiting the crisis, it has said. Local residents have reported seeing Ugandan soldiers moving towards the conflict zone, heightening fears of a regional escalation. Like Rwanda, Uganda has entered eastern DR Congo in the past claiming to be protecting its borders. But it's also accused of looting natural resources, especially gold. Analysts expect it to safeguard its economic interests while keeping an eye on the Rwandans. ""It's very clear that Uganda wants to retain its own influence in eastern DR Congo and not be pushed out by its rival in Rwanda,"" says the ICG's Mr Moncrieff. South Africa has contributed most of the troops to a Southern African regional force fighting alongside the Congolese army and has suffered heavy losses. But it's also been thrust into the headlines because of an astonishingly vitriolic exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg. The South Africans blamed the deaths of 14 of their soldiers on the Rwandan Defense Forces, which President Cyril Ramaphosa disparagingly referred to as the ""RDF militia."" His defence minister claimed he'd warned Kagame that any further shooting would be taken as a declaration of war. This infuriated the Rwandan president, who said that the account of their conversation was a ""lie"" and called the South Africans a ""belligerent"" force that must leave the DR Congo. This is the sharpest end of a broad division between the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). The EAC supports Rwanda's call for direct talks between Kinshasa and the M23. While Sadc condemns RDF attacks on its soldiers, including Tanzanian and Malawian troops, and has reaffirmed their commitment to DR Congo's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

Key sites recaptured by the army this week include the mint – where money is printed. At the time of writing, the RSF still controls most of Khartoum proper. Whereas the army now holds the majority of territory across the wider tripartite capital - meaning Omdurman, Bahri and Khartoum. But, after winning back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira, the army believes it now has the momentum to take the capital too, and break the RSF's almost two-year siege. ""Very soon there will be no rebels in Khartoum,"" announced army leader and de facto ruler Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Tuesday. An end to this conflict cannot come fast enough. Aid workers say people are starving across the country as a result of the war – in Khartoum alone more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine, according to UN-backed researchers. Since war broke out almost two years ago between Gen Burhan and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemedti"" Dagalo who leads the RSF, 12 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of thousands of civilians have been butchered. Sudan is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, agree international aid agencies. They say both the army and the RSF are guilty of committing some of the gravest atrocities imaginable against innocent civilians, including that the RSF has carried out a genocide in Darfur. Both forces deny the accusations. The army has been jubilantly welcomed by many inhabitants of the areas it has recently recaptured, as the RSF has been widely accused of killing and raping civilians in Khartoum, as well as looting the homes of the many residents who have fled the city. Reports of the army's advance have been dismissed by the RSF as ""lies and rumours"". They have made similar denials ahead of every retreat in recent weeks. Analysts say the army's recent successes have been the result of enlisting more fighters and buying more weaponry. Winning back the besieged army headquarters was also a huge boon earlier this month. The army's expulsion of the paramilitary group from the central city of Wad Madani in January was marred by allegations of summary executions and arbitrary retribution attacks on those perceived to be RSF informants or collaborators. This will no doubt raise fears among some Khartoum residents that the same fate awaits them. ""When you open social media and you see all the killing, if you've committed something wrong you must be worried,"" Mustafa told the BBC. ""Some of them led fighters to people's homes. Others joined [the RSF] and stole property, terrorised people - even held women against their will [as sex slaves]. They did horrible things. ""Are they terrified of what is to come? Of course."" But sometimes there is a fine line between being seen as a collaborator, and the reality of survival in war. ""I am worried for my cousin,"" says Amir, who lives in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, which lies just across the River Nile. ""He is not a collaborator or an informant - he often has to deal with these people [the RSF] because he's looking after his mother and his kids. Will he be slaughtered [by the army] or will he be left alone?"" For now, as the army approaches and Sudan's future hands in the balance, all that Mustafa and Amir can do is wait.

,,,reliable,,"Politicians, musicians, and celebrities arrived in their most glamorous looks for one of South Africa's biggest political events - the State of the Nation Address (Sona), making it almost as much about fashion as politics. Sona is a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament in Cape Town to mark the start of the government's work for the year, where President Cyril Ramaphosa paints a picture of where the country stands and outlines the road ahead. In his speech, President Ramaphosa talked about the nation's resilience, earning rapturous applause when he declared, ""South Africa will not be bullied."" His stance comes after his US counterpart Donald Trump threatened to cut funding over South Africa's land policy. While governance takes centre stage, Sona has evolved into a fashion spectacle over the years, with MPs using their outfits to support local designers and showcase South African talent. The outfits are always a hot topic on social media, and this year is no exception. Praise singer Inako Mateza, this year's imbongi (traditional praise poet), played a key role in one of the most significant Sona traditions. Through song and dance, she recounted President Cyril Ramaphosa's life story and history, blending tradition with a personal touch. She ended her performance by addressing the president with his well-known nickname, ""Cupcake."" South Africa Minister of Water and Sanitation, Pemmy Majodina wore a traditional outfit and spectacular earrings. Her Xhosa-inspired outfit was made by self-taught seamstress, Zoleka Vicky Magwaca, from the Mthatha Art Centre in Eastern Cape ""I am committed to supporting local designers,"" Majodina told Eye Witness News on the red carpet. Water was a key part of Ramaphosa's speech, as he said there would be investment in several water projects to address the shortages affecting the whole country. Draped in gold, this snazzy dresser is legendary Kwaito singer, Gezani Kobane, also known as Papa Penny. He is a member of former President Jacob Zuma's party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK). As MK cements its presence in South African politics as the main opposition party, figures like Kobane are drawing attention both for their political stance and their distinctive style. But Zuma wasn't in attendance, as he was dealing with his ongoing trial on allegations of corruption over an arms deal. He denies any wrongdoing. Outside parliament, there is a red carpet for guests and ministers to strike a pose. This year's Sona was held at Cape Town City Hall as the parliament building is still being rebuilt after a fire ripped through the building in 2022. Sports Minister Gayton Mckenzie looked dapper in an all-black ensemble with matching sunglasses. South African politician and Pondo traditional leader Mwelo Nonkonyana, who now serves on the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in the Eastern Cape made sure his heritage was on full display. The traditional beaded staff is a symbol of wisdom and authority, making it the perfect finishing touch for Sona. Julius Malema's party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) arrived in their trademark red overalls. The party has disrupted previous Sonas, but this year they were relatively calm. Malema expressed his disappointment in President Ramaphosa speech and told local broadcaster eNCA, it was just ""waffle"".

,,,reliable,,"Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera has ordered the military to begin preparing to withdraw from their peacekeeping mission in the volatile eastern Democratic of Congo. The Malawian troops are part of the southern African regional bloc's military mission (SAMIDRC) deployed to DR Congo to help tackle armed groups. At least 20 peacekeepers, including 14 South Africans and three Malawians, were killed as the M23 rebels captured the key city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, last week. President Chakwera said on Wednesday that his decision was meant to ""honour the declaration of a ceasefire by the parties"", even though the fighting is continuing. In a statement read on state TV on Wednesday evening, he said the withdrawal of troops would ""pave the way for their planned negotiations towards a lasting peace"". Malawi Information Minister Moses Kunkuyu told the BBC Newsday programme that the planned withdrawal was being ""made in good faith"". He said a meeting by southern African leaders last week in Tanzania, on the sidelines of the Africa Energy Summit, had passed a resolution ""to call for a ceasefire from all parties in the conflict, just to pave way for peaceful negotiations"". ""It is pursuant to that agreement that the president of Malawi has seen it fit to contribute to the peace-building effort by withdrawing troops from the region so that there is that peaceful negotiation"". He did not indicate exactly when the troops would leave, but said what remained were the ""operational aspects"" and that they had communicated the decision to the DR Congo president and the southern Africa bloc. On Monday, the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group declared a unilateral ceasefire ""for humanitarian reasons"", which was due to start the following day. However, fighting has since resumed, and the rebels have reportedly taken the mining town of Nyabibwe in the South Kivu province. The Malawian president has been under pressure to withdraw his country's forces from DR Congo in the wake of the deaths of peacekeepers. South Africa has faced similar pressure, but President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his troops in DR Congo, saying they are subject to the SAMIDRC mission ""which has operational timeframes and an end date"". The mission was initially deployed in 2023 and was last year extended until December this year. The SAMIDRC mission was authorised by the southern African bloc (Sadc) to have 5,000 troops from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania. South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania - although it is not clear how many troops are currently there. Malawi also has some soldiers in DR Congo serving under the UN peacekeeping force Monusco. Sadc leaders are due to meet in Tanzania this Saturday in a special joint summit with East African heads of states to address the DR Congo crisis. Bitter rivals DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame are both expected to attend. Meanwhile, the Ugandan military has denied reports it has sent troops to eastern DR Congo because of the fighting in and around Goma. Since their capture of Goma, the rebels have been seeking to seize territories in South Kivu, especially the capital Bukavu. Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend the city. The rebel group has appointed top officials including a governor of North Kivu, to administer the territory. For the first time since they seized Goma, the M23 on Thursday held a rally in the city that saw rebel leader Corneille Nangaa address large crowds at the Unity Stadium. A warrant for Nangaa's arrest has been issued by a military court in Kinshasa, accusing him of war crimes and treason. The UN says nearly 3,000 people were killed during the M23's violent campaign to seize Goma. There are fears that diseases such as Mpox and cholera could spread beyond the city. The International Criminal Court has said its prosecutors are closely following events in DR Congo ""including the grave escalation of violence over the past week"".

,,,reliable,,"There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging. It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week. The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices. The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal – including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy. It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more – of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23. The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan – the ore from which tantalum is extracted – is mined. Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons. Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry. Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions. They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted. Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a ""state-like administration"", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (£20) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working. It runs the area as a monopoly making sure – through the threat of arrest and detention – that only its authorised traders are able to do business. The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion. There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain. Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say. Theoretically, a traceability system - known as the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics is sourced responsibly and avoids conflict financing and human rights abuses. The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – so-called ""conflict minerals"" – are not inadvertently funding violence. But Itsci has come under some criticism. Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere. Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said. He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption. ""There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves."" In a statement to the BBC, Itsci said it covers 3,000 mine sites and that it works ""at any mine, regardless of their size or remoteness, following the goal of 'leaving no-one behind'... Excluding remote areas would be the opposite of responsible sourcing and would exacerbate potential risks."" Itsci added that these remote communities have benefitted from its support. The scheme has also been praised for bringing ""prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners"". In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town. Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan. The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to ""heavy-duty trucks"" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them. Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is mixed with Rwandan production leading to a ""significant contamination of supply chains"". The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya - setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen. ""A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,"" he told the BBC. Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda. In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country. ""It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,"" she added. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their ""expertise"". Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there. In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using ""conflict minerals"". Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda. Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.

The artist passed away hours after having a seizure, his sister Christel told the BBC, adding that she was not clear on the exact cause of death. Mignon's career took off in 2006 with Minédji, a hit song that remains beloved in Benin almost 20 years later. The West African country's ministry of culture remembered Mignon as ""an emblematic figure of the first generation of urban artists of the 2000s."" ""His songs, with their swaying rhythms and unique energy, marked an entire era and inspired many other talents,"" a statement from the ministry said. Mignon died on Tuesday, after being admitted to hospital in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. The father-of-five had moved to neighbouring Burkina Faso two years ago, for professional reasons. After news of Mignon's death broke, his manager of nine years, Aziz Ademorou, described the musician as ""a fighter who always believed in himself"". Mignon had demonstrated this confidence in an interview with Benin's Frissons Radio. ""I started out with my first single Mindédji, which was both a trial and a master-stroke... the public loved it,"" he said. Mignon was also well known for creating a rhythm and dance style named Noudjihou. Noudjihou was inspired by Benin highlife music. Mignon's music had made an impression in his new home, Burkina Faso, too. In January last year he produced Hymnes Aux Étalons, an African Cup of Nations anthem for Burkina Faso's national team.

The two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay operator - were stargazing with three male tourists near a lake in Hampi, Karnataka, when they were attacked by a group of men on Thursday night, police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters. Arasiddi said the assailants pushed the men into the Tungabhadra River canal before raping the women. Two of the men, one of them American, survived, and the third man's body was recovered on Saturday morning, he said.

Police have arrested two of the men accused of the attack and an investigation is ongoing, Arasiddi said. Police believe the men followed the group. According to witness testimony from one of the women, the group was stargazing near a temple in Sanapur when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked them where they could get petrol. As one member of the group gave them directions, one of the three men demanded 100 rupees ($1.29) from the tourists.

Yoon Suk Yeol walked free on Saturday to cheers from his supporters - but still faces trial on insurrection charges after his failed attempt to impose martial law in December. He was arrested in January in a dawn raid at the presidential palace after a tense fortnight where he had resisted being taken in and there were clashes between his security detail and police. But he walked free on Saturday after 52 days in custody. ""I bow my head in gratitude to the people of this nation,"" he said in a statement distributed by his lawyers following his release. After waving to supporters outside the centre, he was driven in an official convoy back to the presidential compound in Seoul, where he was greeted by more supporters. More than 50,000 protesters staged rallies in his support in the capital on Saturday, while there was also a slightly smaller counter-protest, Yonhap reported. Mr Yoon's lawyers secured his release after arguing it was illegal to hold him in custody. The courts agreed, based on a number of legal technicalities, although the prosecutors described the ruling as ""unjust"". He is due to stand trial later this year for the attempt to put the democratic country under martial law. It only lasted six hours - but polarised the nation. If convicted he could face life in prison or even the death penalty. Although currently suspended from office, Mr Yoon is still South Korea's president in name. He also faces a separate Constitutional Court ruling which will decide on whether to uphold his impeachment and formally strip him from office. The judges' decision is expected in the coming days.

,,,reliable,,"A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work. The protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion. While the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data. A recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work. They also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities. What's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results.

,,,reliable,,"Han Dong-Hoon was driving home from dinner in Seoul on December 3, scanning the radio, when he heard a breaking news update: President Yoon Suk-Yeol was preparing to deliver an emergency address. Han, then the leader of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), was widely seen as one of the presiden't closest allies. Yet that was Han's first hint that Yoon was about to do something unprecedented. By midnight, the president had plunged the country into a political maelstrom, declaring martial law as part of a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea sympathisers. ""When I first heard the news of martial law, I thought, 'We must stop it, because if it isn't lifted that very night, a bloodbath might occur,'"" Han tells BBC Korean. ""The fear and terror that South Korea's decades-long, hard-won achievements might suddenly collapse were overwhelming."" Soon after Yoon's announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader hosted a live stream urging people to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul. Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order. Han was among them. The late-night martial law edict seemed to have come from nowhere. It was, and remains, unclear who in Yoon's party supported or even knew of the move before it was made. But in the hours that followed, Han would help lead a successful attempt to overturn Yoon's order and have the declaration lifted. Weeks later, he would also play a key role in impeaching the disgraced president – a move that would see him branded a ""traitor"" by mainstream members of the PPP, and ultimately lead to his resignation as party leader. Han says he has ""no regrets"" about overturning Yoon's martial law attempt, insisting that he'd ""choose the same again"". But in many people's eyes, his subsequent decision to impeach the very president he'd helped get elected was a surprising heel turn for someone formerly viewed as Yoon's right-hand man. ""We have experienced so much together over many years,"" Han says of his relationship with Yoon. ""I find the current situation extremely painful and regretful. Both the president and I worked in good faith for the betterment of our country – yet I must say that I deeply regret how things have turned out."" For years, Han and Yoon were inseparable allies. Having both attended Seoul National University, the two forged a close bond as prosecutors while jointly investigating corruption in the country's halls of power. Han gained political prominence when Yoon was narrowly elected president in May 2022, after beating his opponent by less than 1% of the vote. Han was made Minister of Justice and later entrusted with the key role of Emergency Countermeasures Committee Chairman for the PPP, becoming the leader of the ruling party at the age of 50. Yoon's time in office was beleaguered by scandals and political failures – not least of all his landslide loss to the opposition Democratic Party last April. The result of those parliamentary elections was widely seen as a vote of no confidence against Yoon, and rendered him a lame-duck president. For most of Yoon's administration, the PPP's conservative base was enthusiastic about Han. The lawyer-turned-politician had quickly emerged as a likely party candidate for the next presidential election, originally scheduled for 2027. Now, as the increasing likelihood of a 2025 election looms amid the fallout of Yoon's ill-fated martial law attempt, Han's reputation is largely defined by the way he acted during and after that fateful night. While some still see him as a fresh and promising political figure, many view him as having betrayed the very president who had furthered his career. In the weeks following Yoon's abortive martial law order, the embattled president curried favour among PPP hardliners by refusing to cede political ground. While he apologised for the events of December 3, he refused to resign, instead holing up in his official residence in defiance of calls for his impeachment. He rallied his base and defended his decision by playing on unsubstantiated fears that the country was in danger. It was these staunch Yoon loyalists who would come to turn against Han. Despite having rejected Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, Han initially opposed the impeachment motion put forth against the president by South Korea's political opposition – siding with almost every other PPP member in boycotting the first vote on December 7. Days later, Han changed course. This was after allegations had emerged that during the martial law attempt Yoon had ordered key political figures – including Han – to be arrested. In allegiance with his close political aides, Han threw his full support behind a second and ultimately successful impeachment attempt, ousting Yoon as president. ""I wanted nothing more than for this government to succeed,"" Han tells the BBC, reflecting on the storm of condemnation that then followed from within his own party ranks. ""I initially sought an orderly early resignation plan for the president – a plan I earnestly pursued, but which ultimately failed,"" he adds. ""I am deeply pained by the outcome and empathise with those who remain unconvinced and heartbroken. Nonetheless, I believe it was a necessary decision for South Korea's continued progress and development."" Yoon has been suspended from his presidential duties and is currently under investigation on insurrection charges. Han, meanwhile, stepped down as PPP leader in mid-December, maintaining that although Yoon's impeachment was painful, he did not regret his decision. In the two months that followed, Han says he took some time to ""quietly reflect"" on whether he could have done more during such a turbulent period for South Korea.",,,,The 'traitor' at the heart of South Korea's impeachment drama,"Richard Kim, BBC Korean, Reporting fromSeoul, Gavin Butler, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore",,,,,,,1

The incident involving the Air Force KF-16 aircraft, in the city of Pocheon near North Korea, was part of routine drills held by the South to maintain combat readiness against potential attacks from the North. South Korea's Air Force said that it was investigating the incident and apologised for the damage, adding it would provide compensation to those affected. While shells from live firing exercises sometimes land near civilian residences, they rarely cause injuries. According to local media reports, two people suffered fractures to their necks and shoulders. A 60-year-old who was driving when the explosion happened had shrapnel lodged in their neck, Yonhap reported. ""I was driving when I heard a 'bang',"" they said. ""When I woke up, I was in an ambulance."" ""Our KF-16 (fighter jet) abnormally dropped eight shells of MK-82 bombs. It landed outside of firing range,"" said Korea's Air Force in a statement to the BBC. The military said the pilot of one of the jets inputted the wrong coordinates by mistake, causing the bombs to drop in the civilian community. Investigators have yet to determine why the second jet dropped its bombs, the military said, adding all live-fire exercises will be suspended. One church building and houses were also damaged as a result of the incident. Images published on local media show a broken window of a building and damaged roof of the church. A local resident told Yonhap that he had been watching television at home when the explosion, which sounded ""like a thunderclap"", shook the house. The director of a nearby senior citizen care centre said that the building's windows shattered and one of their teachers was taken to hospital with injuries. While no seniors were hurt, they said, ""they were so frightened that we sent them all home"". Pocheon authorities told the BBC earlier on Thursday that residents had been evacuated while a bomb disposal team worked on safely disposing any unexploded bombs. But authorities later said they did not find any unexploded bombs at the scene, Yonhap reported. The defence ministry said the training on Thursday was related to a joint drill with US forces. South Korea and the US are set to run combined drills from March 10 to March 20 - the first since US president Donald Trump's return to the White House. This comes at a time when the two countries are increasingly wary of the growing alliance between North Korea and Russia. During another joint drill by South Korea and the US in 2022, troops fired a short-range ballistic missile which malfunctioned and crashed on a golf course in the military base. While the warhead did not explode, it still burst into flames and sent panic rippling across residents in the area.",,,,Fifteen hurt after SK fighter jets drop bombs by accident,"Jake Kwon, Hosu Lee & Koh Ewe, BBC News, Reporting fromSeoul and Singapore",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"North Korea has stopped tourists from visiting, just weeks after the first Western tourists entered the country for the first time in five years. North Korea sealed itself off at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, and started to scale back restrictions in the middle of 2023. It opened up to Russian visitors in 2024, but it was only last month that Western tourists were allowed into the remote, eastern city Rason. However several tour companies now say that trips to the reclusive country have been cancelled until further notice. Pyongyang has not given a reason for the sudden halt. ""Just received news from our Korean partners that Rason is closed to everyone. We will keep you posted,"" China-based KTG Tours, which specialises in North Korean tours, said Wednesday on Facebook. Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours were among the other agencies that have announced the suspension. Those planning tours in April and May should refrain from booking flights ""until we have more information"", Young Pioneer Tours said in a Facebook post. On 20 February, the first Western tourists started arriving in Rason, a city earmarked by the North as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies. Tour operators told the BBC the visitors' movements were even more restricted than on pre-pandemic trips - they had fewer opportunities to wander the streets and talk to locals. Phone signals and internet access were also not available in the hermit state. One tour leader said he suspects Rason was picked because the area is relatively contained and easy to control. Earlier this week, Koryo Tours said it was accepting international applications for the Pyongyang Marathon for the first time in five years. The event is scheduled for 6 April but it is now unclear if these can still be processed.

,,,reliable,,"US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%. This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. Trump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars. China's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (£788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn). It has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. So how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success? Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them. So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it. Increasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth. Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers. Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. He also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade. Yes, analysts say. Exports have been the ""saving grace"" of China's economy and if the taxes linger, exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC. The sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. ""The tariffs will hurt China,"" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. ""They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand."" That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption. While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say. ""Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,"" Ms Garcia-Herrero said. China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an ""early mover"" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy. Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered. ""It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple."" China has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars. And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google. China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs. And yet, Trump's recent tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said. ""Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,"" she said. What concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West. It's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones. Although this could ""impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,"" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said. On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will boost its high-value exports. It happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say. ""The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,"" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC. The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar. A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say. China already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world. ""The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,"" said Mr Cruise of Moody's. But that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020. Analysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico. Chinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.",,,,Can Trump's tariffs break China's grip on manufacturing?,"Joel Guinto, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds. With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five. But the tide has turned. For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge. India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third. ""For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,"" Mr Kumar says. Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. ""Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,"" he says. His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution. The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media ""finfluencers"" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike. Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor. When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market. ""I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!"" For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. ""I'm both ignorant and confident,"" he says with wry candour. ""Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype."" Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. ""The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,"" he says. In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. ""When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed."" Mr Sircar lives in hope. ""My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green."" There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money.

,,,reliable,,"A British man detained in India for six years without trial over a high-profile corruption case must be released on bail, the Delhi High Court has ruled. Christian James Michel, an arms consultant, is accused of bribing Indian officials to win a multimillion-dollar helicopter contract for British-Italian defence company AgustaWestland. He denies the charge. He was extradited to India from the United Arab Emirates in 2018 and has been in custody ever since, in what a judge called an ""exceptional"" situation. The AgustaWestland controversy was one of several corruption cases linked to India's former ruling Congress party, some of which fizzled out eventually. In 2010 the Indian government signed a deal with AgustaWestland's parent company to purchase 12 helicopters. The alleged irregularities came to light when India's federal auditor reported that the government may have vastly overpaid for the $753m (£455m) deal, which was eventually scrapped in 2014. According to court documents, Mr Michel is alleged to have received around €42m ($44.7m, £25m) for securing the contract. His lawyer has argued that there is no evidence to connect him with the alleged offence. India's financial crime fighting agency and domestic crime bureau have held separate investigations into Mr Michel. But both of those investigations have yet to be concluded and trials have yet to begin, leading to a ""prolonged incarceration"" of Mr Michel, the Delhi High Court noted. The judge said his six years in pre-trial custody was also ""alarmingly close"" to the maximum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for money laundering, which is one of the charges he faces. The court decided to grant him bail in one of the cases, after the Supreme Court did the same in another case on 18 February. This means that Mr Michel is now free to leave Delhi's high-security Tihar jail, but he cannot leave India as his passport has been seized. The deal for 12 three-engine AW-101 helicopters was signed in February 2010 after AgustaWestland beat off competition from US and Russian rivals. The aircraft were intended for an elite squadron of the Indian air force which ferries around the president, the prime minister and other VIPs. Only three of the helicopters were delivered to India before the deal was scrapped. Italian prosecutors suspected that kickbacks worth almost $67.6m were paid to Indian officials to secure the contract. Giuseppe Orsi, the former chief of AgustaWestland's parent company which at the time was called Finmeccanica, and Bruno Spagnolini, the former head of AgustaWestland, were tried in Italy on fraud and corruption charges. Both were acquitted in 2018. Indian officials have said their acquittals would have no bearing on the case in India. India's air force chief at the time of the deal was arrested for bribery in 2016, and later released on bail.

,,,reliable,,"After years of speculation, Tesla could finally be making its India debut. The American electric vehicle (EV) giant has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities. Asia's third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla's futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense. But there's a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India's price-sensitive market? Tata Motors currently holds pole position in India's EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra. EVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes. Simply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country. Besides price, India's road conditions could pose a challenge. Tesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car's undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs. Will Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence? ""It's been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can't justify these major engineering changes,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC. Also, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India. In effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market. But at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker. The country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply. Subsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country's top-selling electric car model. It's no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars. ""The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice,"" says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research. In April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (£400m) and starting local production within three years. Tesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world's fastest-growing major economy.",,,,Can Tesla's EVs win over India's price-conscious buyers?,"Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi•@ArunodayM, •",,,,,,,1

At least one person has died in the blaze, which has torched more than 5,200 acres around the northern Japanese city of Ofunato since Thursday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA). Although January to March is typically Ofunato's driest season, the area saw less rainfall last month than any February in more than 20 years - recording just 2.5 millimetres, compared to the usual average of 41. About 4,600 people remain under government-issued evacuation orders as the fire continues to burn. Some 2,000 have already left the area to stay with friends or relatives, and more than 1,200 have evacuated to shelters, officials said. The fires are burning in a forest area of Iwate Prefecture, which is Japan's second largest prefecture and has the country's second-lowest population density. More than 80 buildings are estimated to have been damaged so far, although FDMA noted that details are still being assessed.

,,,reliable,,"India's first medical clinic for transgender people has shut operations in three cities after US President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to it. Mitr (friend) Clinic, which was started in 2021 in the southern city of Hyderabad, offered HIV treatment, support and counselling services to thousands of transgender people. Two more Mitr Clinics in Thane and Pune cities in western India, which were established the same year, have also shut down due to the aid cut. In January, Trump signed an executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review. Trump has said he wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with his ""America First"" approach. His crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid to foreign countries since the 1960s, has been seen as a step to this end. The pausing of USAID funds has affected dozens of development programmes all around the world, especially in poor and developing countries. In India, the shutting down of the Mitr Clinics has impacted the transgender community's access to crucial medical support. The project came into existence under the US President's agency for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 when George Bush was president. John Hopkins University worked in collaboration with USAID and the Indian government to set it up. A staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity to BBC Hindi said the three clinics catered to some 6,000 people and about 6% to 8% of the patients were being treated for HIV. ""All these cases were below 30 years of age. And 75% to 80% of this population was accessing health services for the first time,"" this staff member said. In Hyderabad, the Mitr Clinic offered care to 150 to 200 transgender patients each month, many of whom suffered from HIV. The clinic had a small team of doctors, psychologists and technical staff. ""We were receiving 250,000 rupees ($2900; £2300) every month to provide services,"" Rachana Mudraboyina, a trans woman who was in-charge of the clinic, told BBC Hindi. The news of the clinic's closure has come as a blow to the community. Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, a trans woman who has visited the clinic, told The Indian Express newspaper that she was ""devastated"" by the news as the clinic used to offer treatment at subsidised rates. Another trans woman, who was hoping to use the clinic's services, told the Express that she was sad that she would no longer be able to do this. India is estimated to have around two million transgender people, though activists say the number is higher. Despite a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that gives them the same rights as people of other genders, many still struggle to access education and healthcare due to stigma and discrimination. There are state-run and private hospitals that offer medical help to the community, but many say they prefer going to Mitr Clinics because they find it more affordable and inclusive. ""Transgender people are not treated properly in general hospitals,"" Rachana says, explaining why the Mitr Clinics were so important for the community. Trump's order freezing foreign aid has been criticised by many. ""USAID has made significant contributions in health and education and shutting it down is bound to have an impact on developing countries,"" Bubberjung Venkatesh, a lawyer, told BBC Hindi. ""It's a big blow. Its support for HIV prevention was significant,"" he added. Last Thursday, the Trump administration said it was going to eliminate more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts. This means that very few projects will survive and the Mitr Clinics are unlikely to be among them. Elon Musk, a close aide of Trump who also heads a government department in charge of slashing federal spending and jobs, has criticised funding projects for transgender people. ""That's what American tax dollars were funding,"" Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday in response to a post about the closure of the Mitr Clinics. Meanwhile, staff at the clinic say they are looking for funding from other sources and hope that the state government will step in to help. ""We did a lot more than just provide medical help. The clinic also provided us a space to interact with the community, to share advice about various government schemes and health facilities,"" Rachana says.

,,,reliable,,"Dozens of construction workers have been pulled out alive from metal containers after they were buried by an avalanche in the Himalayas in India's Uttarakhand state. They survived - some as long as nearly two days - as the containers in which they were living had enough oxygen to sustain them until rescuers could dig them out, Indian media reported quoting officials. On Friday, 54 workers were buried when the avalanche hit a construction camp near Mana village. Eight were killed, while the other 46 were rescued. The operation lasted almost 60 hours in sub-zero temperatures and concluded on Sunday. Most of the labourers, who were working on a highway expansion project, were able to ""withstand the wrecking avalanche"" because of the containers, rescuers told The Indian Express newspaper. ""These metal shelters saved most of them. They had just enough oxygen to hold on until we got them out,"" a senior rescue official told The Times of India.

Avalanches and landslides are common in the higher regions of the Himalayas, especially during winter. Experts say that climate change has made extreme weather more severe and less predictable. There has also been a rapid rise in deforestation and construction in Uttarakhand's hilly areas in recent years. In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a piece of a Himalayan glacier fell into the river, triggering flash floods.

,,,reliable,,"YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to ""make India trade"". The wildly popular financial influencer called herself the ""She-Wolf of the stock market"" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees. Last month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain. The regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education. India's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows. Many of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled ""investment gurus"" or ""financial influencers"" like Ms Patel, promising quick money. With only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers. Most operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice. The regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims. Sebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes. The regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration. Sebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024. As markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test. Thousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. Sebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (£10,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (£9m) by selling courses. Ms Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment. While Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity. The regulator has been both a ""selective"" and ""reluctant regulator"", Sucheta Dalal, veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC. ""It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big."" Sumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy. ""Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,"" he says. Manish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed. ""Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,"" Singh told the BBC. Balancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. Technology is inherently disruptive and the law is always ""playing catch-up"". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US. ""It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,"" says Mr Agrawal. A Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. The challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",,,,Ban on India's stock market 'She-Wolf' puts regulators on the spot,"Archana Shukla, India Business Correspondent•@archanajsr, •",,,,,,,1

Since December she hasn't been to her local school, when it decided it would no longer accept Afghans without a valid Pakistani birth certificate. But even if she could go to classes, Nabila says she wouldn't. ""I was off sick one day, and I heard police came looking for Afghan children,"" she cries, as she tells us her friend's family were sent back to Afghanistan. Nabila's not her real name - all the names of Afghans quoted in this article have been changed for their safety. Pakistan's capital and the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi are witnessing a surge in deportations, arrests and detentions of Afghans, the UN says. It estimates that more than half of the three million Afghans in the country are undocumented. Afghans describe a life of constant fear and near daily police raids on their homes. Some told the BBC they feared being killed if they went back to Afghanistan. These include families on a US resettlement programme, that has been suspended by the Trump administration. Pakistan is frustrated at how long relocation programmes are taking, says Philippa Candler, the UN Refugee Agency's representative in Islamabad. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 930 people were sent back to Afghanistan in the first half of February, double the figure two weeks earlier. At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection. But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming.

,,,reliable,,"A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims. The Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board. Police investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were ""thrilled"" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were ""fake victims"" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones. Authorities have taken down at least 427 such posts. But this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech. Following Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation. People whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech. The tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; £231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high. ""People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,"" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald. In later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech. Many South Koreans, he says, now ""view others not as their peers, but as adversaries"", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea. ""We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,"" Prof Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University told the BBC. ""That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself."" Mr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as ""parasites squandering the nation's money"". By way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; £1,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund. ""It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,"" said one such comment. Mr Park says these comments were ""overwhelming"". ""Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?"" he says. ""Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money."" ""Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,"" he adds. ""When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks."" Joshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate, says that hate is often ""directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense"". ""We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick."" In the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse. The accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country. Many supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP. ""The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,"" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as ""100% the fault"" of the party. Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and ""fake bereaved family member"". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out. ""It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,"" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident. Park Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to ""enjoy taking advantage of others' pain"". ""That's simply not something a human being should do,"" he told the BBC. ""I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death."" While there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly. ""Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,"" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds. Reminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng. ""The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.""",,,,They lost their families in a plane crash - then came the online hate,"Kelly Ng & Juna Moon, Reporting fromSingapore and Seoul",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Was it pruning or felling? The alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it. The chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn. The trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture. But rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them. The Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. ""We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,"" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them. The project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000–7,000 still left to be mapped. Despite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined. This is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late. But on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies. The trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says. The Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected ""pleasure gardens"" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. The chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today. According to government literature, in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. Emperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022. Interestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019. But environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees. ""Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,"" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage. ""The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,"" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally. Chinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine. Government projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage. Last week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits. ""The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,"" Mr Bhat says.

,,,reliable,,"Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge. These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world. Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines. ""The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,"" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus. North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there. Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back. But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast. Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip. Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy. Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to ""being on a school trip"". ""You can't leave the hotel without the guides,"" he said. ""A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,"" said Mike. ""I've never had to do that anywhere in the world."" Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. ""Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see."" On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them. For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the ""big-hitting monuments"" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control. Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely. Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. ""I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,"" he said. Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected. ""This was the only place people weren't expecting us,"" Joe said. ""It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it."" But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals. Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. ""On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks."" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people. It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering. Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left. Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. ""Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,"" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. ""It felt like they opened the doors just for us."" The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise ""the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed"". His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling ""his grandma's living room"". The whole window was cracked. ""They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there"", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help. One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg. They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. ""I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me."" Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk. Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. ""I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,"" he said. ""Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.""",,,,First British tourists allowed back into North Korea tell BBC what they saw,"Jean Mackenzie, Seoul correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"At least six people have been killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in northern Pakistan that has been described as the ""University of Jihad"". The blast happened at the mosque within the Darul Uloom Haqqania, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 55km (34 miles) from the northern city of Peshawar. Maulana Hamid ul-Haq, a prominent cleric and the influential head of the school, is among the dead. Police said more than 10 other people had been injured. The seminary has long been associated with the Taliban since several of its members, including the group's founder Mullah Omar, trained there. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan. The explosion occurred after Friday prayers, according to local police. Haq's son, Khuzaima Sami, told the BBC that hundreds were present in the main hall at the time of the blast and that he feared there would be many casualties. An investigation has been launched into the attack. ""Initial reports suggest the blast occurred after Friday prayers as people were gathering to greet Hamid ul-Haq,"" Abdul Rasheed, the district police chief, told the AFP news agency. The seminary - where clerics are taught - also known as a madrassa, is considered one of the region's most renowned religious educational institutions and is an important academic centre of the Deoband school of thought. It has been referred to as the ""University of Jihad"" due to its notable alumni, including Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant Haqqani Network, and his son Sirajuddin Haqqani. Both men played key roles in leading the Taliban's insurgency, first against Soviet forces and later against US and Nato forces, in Afghanistan. Haq, 57, was the son of the influential Pakistani cleric Maulana Sami ul-Haq, widely known as the ""Father of the Taliban"". He became the seminary's vice-chancellor after his father's assassination in 2018, and the head of a faction of the religious Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-S) political party. He also served as a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2002 to 2007. Haq's father had longstanding ties with the Afghan Taliban's leadership, including Mullah Omar. He was considered an influential figure in facilitating negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistani government. Despite their strong connections with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, neither Haq nor his father were directly involved in any anti-state movements. Instead, they were often seen as intermediaries between Pakistan and the Taliban. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attack, as did the Pakistani Taliban.

,,,reliable,,"A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police. Police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space. The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June, which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away. The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation. On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others. During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star. But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face. Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions. She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"". The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts. The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment. Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other five - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025. K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans. But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",,,,Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin,"Fan Wang, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved. A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges. More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs. The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was ""pre-planned"" as a part of a larger conspiracy to ""threaten India's unity"" by the people who were protesting against the law. They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the ""main conspiracy case"". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin. BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions. More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions. Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial. In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows. A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing ""predetermined chargesheets"" and ""falsely implicating"" the accused. In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible. Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out. In two orders, the judge said that he could not ""restrain"" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the ""failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation"" would ""torment the sentinels of democracy"". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any ""real or effective investigation"". The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a ""credible, fair and impartial"" way. Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation. Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots. He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others. Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson. ""Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,"" he told the BBC. When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting. ""They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,"" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries. In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin. In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been ""artificially prepared"", and that ""in all probabilities"" the shop was burnt by a ""mob of persons from the Hindu community"". It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened. Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed. ""All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,"" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father. ""In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence."" He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. ""If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,"" he added. In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots. The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client. In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up. In its order in January, the court ruled that the police ""manipulated"" the video to ""frame"" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the ""actual culprits"". It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done. Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his ""ordeal"". With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police ""should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years"". He also said that ""accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary"". ""If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,"" he added. Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial. Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being ""conspirators"" of the riots. Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail. ""Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,"" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC. In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again. ""Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,"" Mr Hussain said.

,,,reliable,,"At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death. The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre. China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations. It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015. The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations. Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning. Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported. The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past. Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention. The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country. She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday. ""In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,"" Shinawatra said. Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs. ""The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,"" the foreign ministry said. Chinese state media said the group had been ""bewitched"" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country. The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang. Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups. ""What is the Thai government doing?"" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday. ""There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long."" The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody. In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment. ""Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,"" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson. ""Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials."" Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations ""totally destroyed"" the ""charade"" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one ""when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours"". Amnesty International described the deportations as ""unimaginably cruel"". On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged ""all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China."" He accused China of having ""committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang"" in a statement published online. The UN said it ""deeply regrets"" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees ""in the strongest terms"" with Thailand's decision. There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population. Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there. China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

,,,reliable,,"In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people. ""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens. The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law. The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action. Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul. From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored. ""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran. ""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering."" Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime. The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power. However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country. The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask. ""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction. The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within. The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures. However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long. Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"". By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes. While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering. Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"". The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it. But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule. ""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says. ""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says. Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used. The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"". The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment. Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system. In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home. ""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month. The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power. According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid. ""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs. ""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?"" The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint. ""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists. Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used. Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless. ""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC. ""We can do nothing."" *The names of the women interviewed for this piece were changed for their safety With additional reporting by Peter Ball",,,,Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,"Mahjooba Nowrouzi, BBC Afghan Service, Kabul",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"""I swear to God I need help,"" said the man quietly on the other end of the line. The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand. They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough. The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten. He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could. Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills. Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses. ""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people."" Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money. China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border. Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October. He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss. ""They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us."" Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls. The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business. That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds. The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border. Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled. The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses. Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people. Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business. ""If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously,"" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers. ""Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,"" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres. ""We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough."" Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them. But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them. Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital. ""I just want to go home,"" he said over the phone. ""I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.""",,,,"'I need help': Freed from Myanmar's scam centres, thousands are now stranded","Jonathan Head, Lulu Luo and Thanyarat Doksone, BBC News, Reporting fromMae Sot, Thai-Myanmar border",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past. Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce. Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC. Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. ""The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,"" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University. The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as ""Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?"" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure. Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions. He believes that iron technology likely emerged ""independently in multiple regions"". Also, the ""earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly"". If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, ""it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records"", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find ""suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world"". Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites. Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking. Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron. At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity. Some finds are particularly striking. Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC. This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes. ""We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,"" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there ""were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time"". Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,"" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. ""The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,"" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India. ""What's clear now,"" she adds, ""is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent."" Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, ""what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,"" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community. However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, ""Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu."" Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was ""just the starting point"". ""We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.""",,,,Did Iron Age 'begin' in India?

Bhartia is the founder and chairman of Jubilant Bhartia Group. Its subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks is the largest franchisee for Domino's Pizza outside of the US. The woman, who can't be named under Indian law, accuses Bhartia of intoxicating and then ""brutally"" raping her in Singapore. Bhartia has denied the allegations as ""baseless, false and disparaging"" in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company said Bhartia would fully cooperate with the investigation. Jubiliant FoodWorks has not responded separately to the BBC's request for comment. The woman said she first complained to the police on 11 November 2024. But her case was registered only on 22 February on orders of the Bombay High Court after it heard her petition. The petition and the police complaint seen by the BBC alleged that the woman first met Bhartia in 2022 at a five star hotel in Mumbai through a co-accused, who allegedly promised to introduce her to people who could help further her career in the entertainment industry. She alleges that Bhartia agreed to invest in her film project and asked her to come to Singapore, giving her his credit card details to book flight tickets. In the petition, the woman also alleged that the co-accused made a video of the rape in Singapore in 2023. She further alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Bhartia thereafter that year. In the company's filing with the stock exchange, Jubiliant FoodWorks said the court had made it clear it had not gone into the ""merits of the complaint"". It rubbished the allegations against Bhartia saying they were made with a ""clear mala fide intent against him"".",,,,Rape case filed against Domino's Pizza franchise owner in India,"Meryl Sebastian, BBC News, Kochi",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Doctors in the Indian capital, Delhi, have performed a life-changing surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove his ""parasitic"" twin that was attached to his abdomen. A parasitic twin is an underdeveloped conjoined twin that relies entirely on the host twin for survival. They are extremely rare, with less than one case occurring per 100,000 births. The teenager who had a fully developed extra set of limbs and a pelvis - sustained by a chest artery - underwent a two-hour surgery at Aiims hospital in Delhi. Dr Asuri Krishna, who led the team of specialists, said the surgery was particularly challenging because of the patient's age. ""Only 40-50 cases of parasitic twins have been documented in world medical literature and, in those cases, the surgery had been attempted on children,"" Dr Krishna told the BBC. With insufficient medical literature to guide them, the team had to rely on their ""intuition, skill and knowledge"", he added. Parasitic twins form when one foetus partially develops while attached to the other. In this case, the teenager had two fully formed legs, buttocks and external genitalia - weighing nearly 15kg - protruding from his abdomen. Remarkably, the parasitic limbs could feel pain, touch and change in temperature. Dr Krishna said the first thing they did was identify how interconnected the parasitic and host twins were. Through scans, the doctors found out that the parasitic twin was attached to the teen's breastbone and was being supplied blood from a vessel in his chest. ""But there wasn't much connection with other main organs like the liver or kidneys,"" Dr Krishna said, adding that they also found a large cyst in the teen's abdomen. The surgery was done in two stages - first, removing the parasitic twin, then extracting the cystic mass from surrounding organs. A team of doctors, including radiologists, anaesthetists and plastic surgeons, completed the procedure in two-and-a-half hours. ""A mesh of shared blood vessels, nerves and tissues had to be separated. Care had to be taken to see that none of the host's organs or tissues were damaged,"" Dr Krishna said. During surgery, the teen's blood pressure dropped dangerously as 30-40% of his blood flowed to the parasitic twin. But the doctors said they were prepared for it and swiftly stabilised him. The teen was discharged four days after being admitted. He is healthy and has suffered no complications from the surgery, Dr Krishna says. The teenager's unusual appearance made him the subject of gossip and ridicule in his neighbourhood in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The stares and jokes took a toll on his mental health, leaving him feeling isolated and lonely. ""I couldn't travel anywhere or do any physical activity,"" he told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that he had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. The 17-year-old told the Express that he was ecstatic and now wanted to live an active life. ""I hope to study and get a job. A new world has opened up to me,"" he said.",,,,Indian doctors remove teen's 'parasitic' twin in rare surgery,"Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Foodies in China have been reportedly flocking to an unlikely destination - a funeral home - after a noodle dish served at its canteen went viral on social media. The dish is found at the Erlong Funeral Home in the southwestern province of Guizhou. The canteen caters to the funeral home's customers, but as word began to spread about its noodles, hordes of diners - some posing as mourners - began showing up to try the food. Erlong has since announced it will allow some members of the public to eat at its premises, as long as they do not disturb genuine mourners. The funeral home offers various types of noodle dishes during breakfast and supper hours, which cost 10 yuan per bowl ($1.38; £1.09). The most popular type is reportedly the noodles topped with minced pork and peanuts. One Erlong worker told Jiupai News that they ""only served customers who come to the funeral home to handle matters"". But other people have been sneaking in to get a bowl of noodles, the worker said, adding that sometimes queues at Erlong are so long that diners sometimes have to wait a couple of hours to get their food. ""There have been people pretending to be relatives of the deceased, it's hard to tell them apart when it gets crowded, and it's hard to manage,"" he said. To meet the demand, the funeral home has since decided to offer 50 bowls of noodles to members of the public every day - for free - as long as ""they do not affect people's mourning"", according to Erlong's chef in an interview with local media. While the noodle dish was already popular among locals, the craze appeared to have ramped up earlier this month when a social media user posted about the dish while visiting a friend in Guizhou, which is known for its spicy and sour dishes. ""My friend says the food at this funeral home is so good,"" they wrote earlier this month on Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. ""The queue for food is longer than the queue to lay flowers for the deceased."" ""I didn't get to eat the noodles, because my friend's mum didn't know anyone who was holding a funeral service."" Since then, many Chinese social media users have also shared their experiences eating the noodles. On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, one user shared a photo of the dining hall's tickets, with what appeared to be a crowd queuing up for food.

,,,reliable,,"India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates. The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm. Another 300 million are ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact. What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not ""widening"" as much as it is ""deepening"", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier. All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of ""premiumisation"" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings. This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the ""experience economy"" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes. Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. ""Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share."" The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power. In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%. The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses. The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic. Much of the consumption spending of the ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and ""turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption"", says Pai. In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be ""dramatic"" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai. But major longer-term headwinds remain. India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers. ""The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],"" says the report, published in January. ""This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,"" it adds. The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. ""The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,"" it adds. The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well. It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption. ""India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,"" the survey says.

Prices had soared after a military coup in 2021 triggered civil war. He could barely feed his young family and was badly in debt. They all lived in his mother-in-law's house, in a village where thatched houses lined dirt roads, a few hours' drive from the country's largest city, Yangon. Zeya, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, knew of local people who had sold one of their kidneys. ""They looked healthy to me,"" he says. So he started asking around. He is one of eight people in the area who told BBC Burmese they had sold a kidney by travelling to India. Illegal organ trading is a problem across Asia, and Zeya's story gives an insight into how it takes place. Buying or selling human organs is illegal in both Myanmar and India, but Zeya says he soon found a man he describes as a ""broker"". He says the man arranged medical tests and, a few weeks later, told him a potential recipient - a Burmese woman - had been found, and that both of them could travel to India for the surgery. In India, if the donor and recipient are not close relatives, they must demonstrate that the motive is altruistic and explain the relationship between them.

Around 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning. Officials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel. They have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies. Jupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that ""the chances of their survival are very remote."" On Monday an expert team of ""rat-hole miners"" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023. Approximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday. Rescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down. As rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. ""I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again,"" said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state.

,,,reliable,,"India and the UK have restarted free trade talks, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions. The talks focused on ""advancing"" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was ""balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial"", Goyal wrote on X. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a ""top priority"" for his government. ""Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,"" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting. India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions. ""India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,"" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a ""separate issue"" from immigration. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations. It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.

,,,reliable,,"New Zealand's commerce minister Andrew Bayly has resigned as a government minister after he ""placed a hand"" on a staff member's upper arm last week, in what he described as ""overbearing"" behaviour. Bayly said on Monday that he was ""deeply sorry"" about the incident, which he described as not an argument but an ""animated discussion"". He remains a member of parliament. His resignation comes after he was criticised last October for calling a winery worker a ""loser""- including putting his fingers in an 'L' shape on his forehead - and allegedly using an expletive directed at them. He later issued a public apology. ""As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios,"" Bayly said in a statement announcing his resignation. ""Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."" He said a complaint had been made but would not elaborate further on exactly what had happened. Bayly resigned last Friday, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon later told a press conference, adding that the incident happened three days earlier, on 18 February. Luxon said on Monday the government's handling the issue within a week was ""pretty quick"" and ""pretty impressive"". He denied that he should have asked Bayly to step down following October's winery incident, and said ""never say never"" when asked if there was a way back for the 63-year-old into another cabinet position. However, Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised Luxon as being ""incredibly weak"", saying the incident with the staff member should not have been dragged over the weekend. ""Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible not to get over it,"" he told reporters on Monday. Bayly himself said that he had to talk to his family and ""would have had difficulty"" speaking to the media earlier. He was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 2014 as an MP for the current ruling National Party. He was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing, and Minister of Statistics following Luxon's election in late 2023. He was also appointed minister for the ACC - the national accidental injury compensation scheme - following a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. Before joining politics, Bayly worked in the finance industry. Luxon said Scott Simpson, National's senior whip, would take over the ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs portfolios. Bayly is the first minister to resign of his own accord under PM Luxon, whose favourability has dipped considerably, according to recent polls. Both the 1News-Verian poll and the Post/Freshwater Strategy poll show his National-led coalition government is losing support among voters.

,,,reliable,,"Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. ""Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,"" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living. Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. ""It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,"" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours ""may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive"". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. ""We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,"" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential ""challenge"" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that ""the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts"". The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. ""Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,"" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. ""We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?"" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given. Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. ""In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,"" he added. But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees. ""Can a house be built with this much money?"" he asked. Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. ""The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,"" said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities ""have all the data to continue with the project"". Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting ""a dangerous precedent"" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas. ""And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised,"" he added.

,,,reliable,,"For months, Japan's entertainment industry has been rocked by a scandal that unseated one of its most popular celebrities and put one of its biggest broadcasters at risk. But some believe it has also marked a turning point in how cases of sexual assault are perceived in Japan - where traditionally victims have been shamed into silence. At its heart was Masahiro Nakai, a household name and leading presenter for Fuji TV, one of the country's biggest broadcasters. Nakai, who is also a former member of J-pop boy band SMAP, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a dinner party in 2023. The revelations, which appeared last December in the weekly tabloid magazine Josei Seven and were then picked up by the Shukan Bunshun, marked the latest of a series of scandals involving celebrities in Japan, including that of late entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa, who was found by investigators to have abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades. Nakai didn't admit guilt and denied using force against the woman. But he apologised for ""causing trouble"" in a statement and said that he had ""resolved"" the matter in a settlement, reportedly worth more than half a million dollars. But as public anger mounted, he was forced to announce his retirement from the entertainment industry in January. Another channel, the Tokyo Broadcasting System, has also stopped airing a program that Nakai regularly appeared on as an MC. The impact on Fuji TV has been devastating. The broadcaster's reputation is now in ruins. Its revenue is under threat and some of its top executives have also been forced to step down. High-profile companies like Nissan and Toyota were among those who pulled advertising from the broadcaster as outrage grew. Fuji TV has since admitted it allowed Nakai to continue presenting shows even after finding out about the allegations. ""If this had happened 10 years ago, there would not have been this outcry,"" Keiko Kojima, who worked in Japan's media industry for 15 years as a TV presenter, told the BBC. Sexual violence against women is one of Japan's worst-kept secrets. A 2020 survey claimed that more than 70% of sexual assaults in the country go unreported. And according to a 2024 study published in the International Journal of Asian Studies, for every 1,000 rapes in Japan, only 10–20 result in a criminal conviction – and fewer than half of convicted rapists are incarcerated. ""There's still a prevalent attitude of 'Shoganai ' or 'there's nothing you can do' that is being projected on women - so they're encouraged to keep silent,"" Machiko Osawa, professor emeritus at Japan Women's University in Tokyo, told the BBC. She added that women were seldom believed and did not have proper mechanisms to even report such incidents, which contributed to this culture of silence. Ms Kojima said that the media industry, in particular, has long had a culture of impunity and lack of accountability where many young women felt they must keep silent to keep their jobs. ""It was common for men to make rude comments about women's bodies or appearance or age. I remember my colleagues and I being asked how many people we've had sex with,"" she said. ""We were expected to reply with a sense of humour without getting angry or offended. I saw sexual harassment and other forms of derogatory treatment of women on a daily basis. For a woman, adapting to these situations was the only way to become a full-fledged TV or media professional."" The Fuji TV case has also raised questions about dinners and drinking parties involving celebrities and young women - and how common they were. Although Shukan Bunshun retracted an earlier report that claimed the alleged assault took place at a party organised by Fuji TV, Ms Kojima told the BBC that it was indeed common to use women as ""tools for entertaining"". ""In Japanese working culture, it's an everyday practice to half-forcibly take young female employees to events to entertain clients,"" she said. ""Men are happy when young women join them. The idea that women are like a gift and that taking a young woman with you is a way of offering hospitality to the other person is very common."" That is why the fallout from this scandal has encouraged women's rights activists. Minori Kitahara, one of the founders of the Flower Demo movement - where groups of sexual violence survivors and their supporters gather in public spaces on the 11th of every month - admitted she was surprised at how swiftly and severely the sponsors reacted. ""Even if it's more of self-preservation than human rights for sponsors, this is a turning point for the MeToo movement in Japan,"" she told the BBC. ""It's up to us how big we make it."" Nearly 50 companies have walked away from the now-tarnished Fuji TV. The Japanese government has also withdrawn all its recent and planned advertisements with the network. And it has called on the broadcaster to regain the trust of viewers and sponsors. So far Fuji TV seems to have done neither. The scandal and Fuji TV's role in hiding it have sent the company on a crisis-management frenzy that seems to have led to deeper disgrace, fuelling even more public anger. Fuji TV president Koichi Minato admitted that the company had known about the allegation shortly after the alleged incident. But he said they chose not to disclose it at the time because they ""prioritised the woman's physical and mental recovery as well as the protection of her privacy."" After a press conference held in the hope of defusing the outrage turned into a PR disaster, the company held a second one that lasted 10 hours. It was intended to show remorse. Both Fuji TV's chairman Shuji Kano and its President Koichi Minato stepped down, bowing humbly as they announced their resignations. The firm said its executive vice-president Kenji Shimizu would replace Mr Minato as president. But this was seen as a mere face-saving exercise to appease advertisers rather than a sign of substantial change - especially because the president's replacement belonged to the same leadership cadre. Professor Osawa told the BBC, however, that high-profile cases like Fuji TV become important precedents for real change. And this is the latest saga in a series of prominent sexual misconduct cases that have generated conversation about women's rights in Japan. These include the case of journalist Shiori Ito, who became a symbol of the country's MeToo movement in 2017. She took the rare step of going public with allegations that Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a well-known TV journalist, had raped her after she met him for drinks. While he denied the allegations, she won a civil lawsuit against him in 2019 ""People have now started to realise that it was OK to speak out and say that this [sexual harassment] is a problem. We are changing what we take as the norm,"" Ms Kojima said. But Ms Kojima and Ms Kitahara both say that Japan is not moving fast enough. ""I think it's time for that generation [of media leadership] to step down. The industry needs to create a new corporate culture. The change is slow,"" Ms Kojima said. ""The TV industry has long neglected the issue of exploitation and violence and has not dealt with the victims properly. If the root of the problem doesn't change, the same will happen again."" Professor Osawa agrees that Japan still has a long way to go because of the ubiquitous power imbalance in the country. She adds that while women have been part of the workforce for decades they're still seen as the ""caretakers"" and men as the ""breadwinners"" by a society that is heavily shaped by patriarchal values. ""This is an important time... But it's unclear how far attitudes will change,"" she said.",,,,Is the downfall of a Japanese star a turning point for women's rights?,"Shaimaa Khalil, Tokyo correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A British couple in their 70s have been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were returning to their home in Bamiyan on 1 February when they were detained. The couple have been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years and their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. It is not known exactly what the couple were arrested for but projects run by them include one training mothers and children, which had apparently been approved by the local authorities despite a ban by the Taliban on women working and on education for girls older than the age of 12. The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970. Since 2009 they have been running training projects in five schools in Kabul and one project in Bamiyan training mothers and children. While the Taliban's return to power in August 2021 saw most of their staff leave – along with most westerners – Mr and Mrs Reynolds insisted on staying put. After their arrest, the couple were initially able to keep in touch with their four children by text message. The family knew that their parents were being held by the interior ministry and were assured by them that they were ""fine"". Three days later, however, the texts stopped. The children have heard nothing since.",,,,British couple in their 70s arrested by Taliban,"Emma Rossiter, BBC News, Leigh Milner, News correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The last time India and Pakistan clashed in a major ICC 50-over contest was in 2023, at the highly anticipated World Cup league match in Ahmedabad. As a contest, it turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax - India, in dominant form, comfortably chased down a subpar Pakistan target, securing a resounding victory. And as Pakistani fans didn't get visas to travel to India, aside from the cricket team, the country's only notable presence was in the media centre. Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy clash between the arch-rivals at Dubai International Stadium promises a vastly different atmosphere. The International Cricket Council (ICC) reported that tickets sold out within minutes - and with the UAE hosting more than 3.7 million Indians and nearly 1.7 million Pakistanis, a vibrant and well-represented crowd from both nations is all but guaranteed. But can a sea of green flags in the stands inspire Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan's men to defy the odds in this must-win clash against Rohit Sharma's India? Pakistan can take comfort in their strong head-to-head record in UAE - 19 wins in 28 ODIs, plus a lone T20I victory in the 2021 World Cup in Dubai. Most of Pakistan's wins against India came at Sharjah during their dominant run in the 1980s and '90s, winning 18 of 24 games there. In Dubai, India beat them twice in the 2018 Asia Cup, while both teams won a game each in a 2006 Abu Dhabi series. Since Pakistan's glory days in Sharjah, the tide has shifted - apart from the occasional T20I win, India has largely dominated in the new millennium. Veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon feels there is no reason to look at India-Pakistan clashes in the UAE through the prism of the past. ''There is no doubt that Pakistan enjoyed tremendous crowd support in the Sharjah days, with the local Pathan population making up the numbers. However, the team then boasted of the likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Aamer Sohail and the two Ws [Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis],"" Memon says. ""Compare that to the state of the current team, which comes up with some exceptional results from time to time but lacks any form of consistency."" The glitzy, ever-expanding United Arab Emirates city-state of Dubai offers little sign of a major cricket event - there are no welcome banners at the airport. Instead, hoardings of Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek and company dominate, as the city is in full swing for the annual Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. Head south, and the 'Ring of Fire' at Dubai International Stadium emerges from the highway, signalling cricket's presence. Towering images of all eight captains line the arena, but for the next two days, all eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Rizwan's teams as fans worldwide await their fate. It's no secret that catering to broadcasters and marketing demands, the ICC consistently places India and Pakistan in the same group for major tournaments. This ensures at least one high-stakes league clash, with the potential for a blockbuster rematch in the knockouts. At a time when cricket faces overexposure and its international structure is threatened by the rise of T20 franchise leagues, the India-Pakistan rivalry remains its biggest box-office draw. A big plus about the tight, top-eight team format of the ICC Champions Trophy is that a little slip-up can cost even the heavyweights dear. ''The 50-over World Cup gives you a chance to pull back even if you stumble in the odd game as there are 10 games in the fray. It's much different here where all three of your group matches are important to proceed to the semi-finals,'' India captain Sharma said on the eve of their opening match against Bangladesh. India cleared their first hurdle with a six-wicket win against Bangladesh on Thursday, powered by Shubman Gill's classy century (cementing his status as a future ODI captain), Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul and a quickfire cameo from skipper Sharma, who crossed the 11,000-run mark in the format. Jasprit Bumrah's absence - expected as he recovers from a back spasm sustained in the final Test in Australia - remains a talking point. However, on this wicket, the spotlight is set to shift to the spinners. Pakistan's lead-up to the tournament has been a rollercoaster - both unpredictable and vulnerable. Their last three ODIs paint the picture perfectly. Ten days ago, Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha's stunning 260-run stand powered Pakistan to a record 353-run chase against South Africa in Karachi, securing a spot in the Tri-series final. But just two days later, they faltered, looking ordinary as New Zealand cruised to a five-wicket win, denying them a confidence boosting title ahead of the Champions Trophy. Then on Wednesday, after their bowlers made early inroads, they let the Kiwis off the hook, eventually crashing to a 60-run defeat in their tournament opener. This has put their backs against the wall ahead of the big game - and what has irked former Pakistan greats is captain Rizwan's statement that they will take the India match as ""just another game"". History shows that Pakistan thrives in such situations, echoing Imran Khan's legendary ""caged tigers"" rallying cry from their triumphant 1992 World Cup campaign. Yes, the odds favour India, but Pakistan can never be written off on UAE soil.

,,,reliable,,"US President Donald Trump's remark that his country spent $21m to boost voter turnout in India's elections has triggered a political slugfest in the country. He made the remark days after a team led by Elon Musk said it had cancelled the payout as part of its crackdown on a US agency providing foreign aid. India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the payout an ""external interference"" and accused the opposition Congress party of seeking this intervention. The Congress denied the allegation, calling Trump's claims ""nonsensical"". The US has not provided any evidence to support its claim. On Friday, India's foreign ministry said it found the claims ""deeply troubling"". Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was ""premature"" to make public statements about the matter at this stage and that relevant authorities were investigating it. Trump vowed to boost the US economy and soon after returning to office, he created the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Musk, to slash federal spending and jobs. Musk says Doge's mission is to save taxpayer money and cut national debt. One of its biggest moves - now making global headlines - is a crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid since the 1960s. Musk, who has called USAID a ""criminal organisation"", announced on Sunday that funding for several projects had been cancelled. The cuts included $486m for the ""Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening"", with ""$21m for voter turnout in India"" and ""$22m for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova"". Defending Doge's cuts, Trump said India ""had a lot of money"" and was among the world's highest-taxing nations. On Thursday, he doubled down, questioning the $21m spend on ""India's voter turnout"". The latest comments came a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first Washington visit under Trump's second term, where Trump announced expanded military sales, increased energy exports and plans for a trade deal and new defence framework. ""I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government,"" the US president said at a summit in Miami. The same day, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaking at an event in London before the 2024 general election. In the clip, Gandhi can be heard saying that major democracies like the US and European countries were ""oblivious that a huge chunk of democratic model has come undone [in India]"". ""Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers - from the US to Europe - to intervene in India's internal affairs,"" Malviya alleged in his post on X. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh dismissed the claim and urged the government to report on USAID's decades-long support to governmental and non-governmental institutions during PM Modi's tenure. Despite widespread reports, neither Doge nor Trump has provided evidence that USAID gave India $21m for voter turnout. India's poll panel has not responded, but former election chief SY Qureshi denied receiving such funding during his tenure, which ran from 2010 to 2012. Earlier, Malviya claimed that in 2012, under Mr Qureshi, the panel signed an agreement with a group linked to George Soros' foundation - primarily funded by USAID - to support a voter turnout campaign. Mr Qureshi dismissed the allegation as ""malicious"", stating that the agreement explicitly imposed ""no financial or legal obligation on either side"". On Friday, the Indian Express newspaper said in an investigative report that the $21m was sanctioned for Bangladesh and not India. It was meant to run for three years until July 2025 and that $13.4m had already been spent, according to records accessed by the newspaper.",,,,Trump's '$21m for voter turnout' claim triggers political row in India,"Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A notorious gang leader has died after he was shot inside a courthouse in Sri Lanka by a gunman disguised as a lawyer, say police. Police say the gunman used a revolver which was smuggled in a hollowed-out book by a female suspect, who remains at large. Gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne had been escorted to court to face proceedings when he was shot. Police say he was a suspect in multiple murder cases. The shooting in the capital Colombo is among a series of killings by rivalling gangs, which has persisted as authorities vow to crack down on gang violence in the country. The gang leader, popularly known as Ganemulle Sanjeewa, had been in custody since he was arrested in September 2023. Police said he had been escorted to the courthouse on Wednesday by a dozen police officers. He was taken to hospital after he was shot but was pronounced dead on arrival. The gunman managed to flee the scene but was later captured by police. He has been identified differently by authorities and local media, but police say that he used several names. Police have identified the female suspect as 25-year-old Pinpura Dewage Ishara Sewwandi. Authorities have put out a notice promising a reward for anyone providing information on the woman. Police say they have also arrested a policeman and van driver suspected of helping the two suspects in the shooting. Lawmakers discussed reining in gang violence in parliament on Wednesday, with an opposition MP calling it a ""major security issue"". Health and mass media minister Nalinda Jayatissa, who in December had pledged to crack down on such criminal activity, said on Wednesday that the government would ""take the actions of organised underworld gangs seriously."" The incident has also raised questions about security in the courthouse, with authorities currently reviewing security measures. New security protocols are being implemented in the wake of the shooting, including deploying armed guards when certain people are brought to court. Armed security personnel are not typically allowed in court, justice minister Harshana Nanayakkara said on Thursday.

,,,reliable,,"The leaders of Hong Kong's Democratic Party have announced plans to dissolve what was once the city's largest opposition group. Members will soon vote on the final decision on whether to shut down the 31-year-old party, chairman Lo Kin-hei said. The party has been struggling to survive following moves by China to crack down on dissent in the city in the wake of the 2019 protests. Beijing and Hong Kong's government have argued that such moves were necessary for national security. As part of the crackdown, Beijing overhauled the former British colony's polling systems. The so-called ""patriots law"" was passed in Hong Kong in 2021 that ensured only people regarded as loyal to the Communist regime in Beijing could serve as lawmakers or local councillors in the semi-autonomous territory. This law effectively barred the Democratic Party from taking part in elections. At a late-night press conference on Tuesday after a party meeting, Mr Lo said the party's leaders had made the call to wind down based on the ""current political situation"". ""Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult, and it's especially difficult in the past few years,"" Mr Lo said to reporters. He did not comment when asked if the party's leaders' decision had been made under political pressure. The party has set up a work group for the shutdown process. At least 75% of its members attending an upcoming general meeting will have to approve the move before it is final. A date for that meeting is yet to be set. On Wednesday, Hong Kong government adviser Regina Ip accused the Democratic Party of pursuing an agenda that opposed China and ""constantly causing trouble inside and outside parliament"". ""Therefore I am not surprised at all that they have been losing supporters in recent years... the Democratic Party has already reached a dead end,"" said Ms Ip, co-convener of Hong Kong's cabinet-like Executive Council. The Democratic Party was notable for having rare direct negotiations with the Liaison Office - the Chinese Communist government's representation in Hong Kong - in 2010, to discuss plans for more liberal elections. Its younger members, however, saw those negotiations as a betrayal. The move triggered a split while the party lost support. It subsequently regained strength and became the most successful opposition political force in the city after acquiring the most seats in the 2019 local council elections, which took place during the violent anti-government protests. A number of the Democratic Party's members - including prominent pro-democracy figures Helena Wong, Lam Cheuk-ting, Wu Chi-wai and Albert Ho - are among the Hong Kong 47 group of campaigners jailed under the controversial national security law. Another member, former legislator Ted Hui, is now living in Australia in exile and is wanted by the Hong Kong government for alleged national security offences. Earlier this week a court issued an order to confiscate his assets and money in Hong Kong, which are held by his family and a law firm. In December, Hong Kong stripped the honorary Justice of the Peace title from Martin Lee KC, a key founder of the Democratic Party, after the veteran barrister lost his appeal against an unauthorised assembly conviction.",,,,Hong Kong's main opposition party announces plan to dissolve,"Martin Yip, BBC Chinese, Reporting fromHong Kong, Tessa Wong, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore",,,,,,,1

While no injuries were reported among passengers, six elephants died from the accident in Habarana, east of the capital Colombo. Two injured elephants were being treated, police said, noting that it was the worst such wildlife accident the country had seen, AFP reported. It is not uncommon for trains to run into herds of elephants in Sri Lanka, where casualties on both sides of human-elephant encounters are among the highest in the world. Last year, more than 170 people and nearly 500 elephants were killed in human-elephant encounters overall - and around 20 elephants are killed by trains annually, according to local media. Elephants, whose natural habitats are affected by deforestation and shrinking resources, have increasingly strayed into places of human activity. Some have urged train drivers to slow down and sound the train horns to warn animals ahead on railway tracks. In 2018, a pregnant elephant and its two calves similarly died in Habarana after being struck by a train. The three had been part of a larger herd crossing the train tracks at dawn. Last October, another train ran into a herd in Minneriya, about 25km (15 miles) away from Habarana, killing two elephants and injuring one.

,,,reliable,,"Rescuers have ended a 44-day search operation after they found the bodies of five men who were trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India's north-eastern state of Assam. DNA tests will be conducted to identify the men as the bodies are in a decomposed state, a state official told the BBC. On 6 January, nine miners were trapped after water flooded the so-called ""rat-hole"" mine, which is a narrow hole dug manually to extract coal. Four bodies were recovered within the first week, and search operations had continued until Wednesday, when the remaining bodies were found. ""The process to identify the remains has been initiated,"" Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the social media platform X. The families of the miners have also been called to identify the bodies. They will be given compensation by the state government, said Riki Phukan, an official from Assam's District Disaster Management Authority. The search operations - at the Umrangso coal mine in Assam's Dima Hasao district - were jointly conducted by special disaster forces alongside the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the state police and the district disaster authority. Divers and helicopters were also deployed but the remote, hilly terrain of the mine had posed severe challenges. Earlier, one of the men rescued from the mine had shared with the BBC a harrowing account of the moments after the tunnel was suddenly engulfed by water. Ravi Rai, a worker from Nepal, said that he was working inside the mine when water entered the pit. ""We were holding on to a rope in 50-60ft (15-18m) deep water for at least 50 minutes before being pulled out,"" he said. Despite a ban on ""rat-hole"" mining in India since 2014, small illegal mines continue to be operational in Assam and other north-eastern states. Six workers were killed in January 2024 after a fire broke out in a rat-hole coal mine in Nagaland state. In 2018, at least 15 men were trapped in an illegal mine in Meghalaya after water from a nearby river flooded it.

,,,reliable,,"The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rejected a government report that found high levels of contamination in a key bathing place at the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering. The report said the waters at Sangam - the confluence of rivers considered holy by Hindus - in Prayagraj city had alarming levels of untreated sewage and bacteria found in human and animal excreta, making it unfit for bathing. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath insisted that the water was not just fit for bathing, but also safe for doing aachman - the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing. Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January. The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years. Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation. The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February. However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival. Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality. But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels. Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water. The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more. The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added. Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. ""All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification,"" he said. ""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards,"" he added. He accused the opposition of running a ""false campaign"" to defame the Kumbh Mela. This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela. On one of the most auspicious bathing days in January, at least 30 people died in a crush that took place near the Sangam. On Sunday, another crush at the New Delhi Railway Station - where thousands of devotees had gathered to board trains for Prayagraj - killed around 18 people.",,,,"No faecal bacteria in Kumbh Mela river waters, says minister","Cherylann Mollan, BBC News, Mumbai",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny. Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death. Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying. As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to meaningful change. South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world – that's four times the population of South Korea. But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry. South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising. This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive ""super fans"" who can make or break careers. That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds. ""It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,"" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law. Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend. Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some, Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. ""YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation. ""There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments,"" he says. Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress. Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims. ""This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,"" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday. Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize. ""Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,"" Prof Na added. Last year, the BBC reported on how ""super fans"" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script. It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023. It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender. In South Korea, it is ""extremely tough"" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their ""idol"" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin. He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even ""add a rockstar-like edge"" to celebrities' reputations. ""While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,"" he says. While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been. Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.

Carlito Cernal, village chief of Barangay Addition Hills in central Manila, announced the bounty of one peso (less than two US cents) for every five mosquitoes. While news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health. The move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines. The programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease. The bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light. A total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far, he told the BBC. The bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday. ""Mosquito farming is coming,"" one social media comment read.

,,,reliable,,"A man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attempted murder of Japan's former prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023. Ryuji Kimura, 25, hurled a pipe bomb at Kishida as the country's leader approached a crowd for a speech during an election event in the city of Wakayama. Although Kishida was unharmed, the explosion of the homemade device caused minor injuries to a police officer and a member of the public. The attack shocked Japan as it came less than a year after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead at an outdoor election campaign event. Kimura, who was sentenced on Wednesday, claimed during questioning his intention was not to kill Kishida, but to object to the country's election age regulation which prevented him from getting into politics. The minimum age to become a member of parliament in Japan is 25 for the House of Representatives and 30 for the House of Councillors. Kimura further added that he threw the bomb to bring attention to a civil lawsuit he filed in 2022, claiming the age restriction was unconstitutional, which was dismissed. Kimura's defence argued he should not face a charge of attempted murder, as he did not expect the bomb to cause injuries, and that a three-year prison sentence would be reasonable given the extent of those injuries. The court stated, however, that the explosives were powerful enough to cause fatal damage. When handing down the ruling, presiding judge Keiko Fukushima noted that ""targeting a serving prime minister caused significant anxiety to society as a whole."" In addition to the attempted murder charge, Kimura was also found guilty of violating explosives regulations and firearms control laws. His 10-year sentence is five years less than what prosecutors had sought. While violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan, anxiety around politicians' security has surged in the wake of Abe's assassination in 2022. The attempted attack on Kishida, which came less than a year later, raised questions as to why there was not a tighter security presence around the country's leader at that time.",,,,Man jailed for attempted murder of former Japan PM,"Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondent, Reporting fromTokyo, Gavin Butler, BBC News, Reporting fromSingapore",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Asha Roy, 17, was excited to take part in a women's football tournament, but her hopes were dashed as Islamists forced the organisers to cancel the match in northern Bangladesh. Shortly before the game began earlier this month, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh group announced a protest rally against the event in Rangpur region, saying it was un-Islamic. Fearing trouble, local police stepped in and the women's team members were asked to return to their home for their safety. ""I was frustrated and frightened. We had never faced such a situation before. It was disappointing that we came back without playing,"" Ms Roy told the BBC. Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, is currently undergoing a political transition after widespread protests ousted its authoritarian government last year. An interim administration is currently in charge but there are concerns that Islamist groups, which had been pushed to the fringes, have become emboldened again. The women's football match was the third to be cancelled in northern Bangladesh in less than two weeks due to the objections of religious hardliners. In the Dinajpur area, roughly 70km (43 miles) west of Rangpur, Islamists protesting against a game clashed with locals who supported it, leaving four people injured. For girls such as Asha Roy, who come from rural areas, football and other sports are a source of female empowerment and a way out of poverty. Those who shine can be selected to play for sponsored teams and some go on to represent Bangladesh internationally. Many girls have been inspired to take up football thanks to the success of the national women's team, who are considered heroes after winning two consecutive South Asia Football Championships in recent years. Ms Roy's teammate, Musammat Tara Moni, said she would not stop playing despite the threats. ""It's my dream to represent our national team. My family supports me, so I am not losing hope,"" the 16-year-old said. For their coach Nurul Islam, the objections came as a surprise. ""I have taken the team to many tournaments for the past seven years, but it's the first time we have faced a situation like this,"" he said. The Islamists insist that the match they stopped was against their religious values and say that they are determined to prevent any future football games. ""If women want to play football, they should cover their entire body, and they can play only in front of female spectators. Men cannot watch them play,"" Maulana Ashraf Ali, the leader of the Islami Andolan Bangladesh in the Taraganj area of Rangpur, told the BBC. Mr Ali also insisted that the group ""definitely"" want hard-line Islamic Sharia law in Bangladesh. The cancellation of the women's football matches caused an uproar on social media, leading the authorities to reorganise one of them. They have also launched an investigation into the incidents but say the fear of radicalism is exaggerated. ""There is no truth in the allegations that the government is pandering to Islamists,"" Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, told the BBC. Mr Alam pointed out that hundreds of women's sports matches were held as part of a national youth festival in January, and that they were played across the country without any trouble. Some people are not reassured. Samina Luthfa, assistant professor of sociology in the University of Dhaka, told the BBC the cancellation of the women's football matches was ""definitely alarming"". ""The women of Bangladesh will not stop playing football and will not stop from going to work or doing their things,"" she said, adding that ""everyone will fight"" efforts to remove women from public spaces. Other decisions made by the interim government since it assumed power in August in relation to Islamist hardliners have also raised concerns. They include revoking a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which was introduced in the last days of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government. Jashimuddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist militant group Ansarullah Bangladesh (ABT) - now known as Ansar al Islam - was released in August after a court granted him bail. He was sentenced to five years in prison in connection with the killing of a secular blogger in 2013, but had been kept behind bars because of other pending cases. According to local media reports, several other people accused of having links with extremist groups have also been given bail in the past few months. ""Though security forces say they will monitor those released, it will be difficult for them to put everybody under surveillance given the limitations,"" says Dr Tawohidul Haque, a crime analyst from the University of Dhaka. While most Bangladeshis practise moderate Islam and secular values dominate society, Islamic extremism is not a new phenomenon in the country. A decade ago, religious zealots targeted secular bloggers, atheists, minorities, foreigners and others in a spate of attacks - killing dozens and sending others fleeing abroad. In one such incident, a group of Islamist gunmen stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka in 2016, killing 20 people. It is not just women's football games that have been targeted recently either. Last week, dozens of Islamist students vandalised a book stall at Dhaka's famous Ekushey Book Fair. The protesters were angry over the display a book by the exiled feminist author Taslima Nasrin, who has in the past received death threats from Islamist groups for what they say are her blasphemous writings. Muhammad Yunus condemned the incident saying the attack ""shows contempt for both the rights of Bangladeshi citizens and for the laws of our country."" The police are investigating. Meanwhile, one of the country's best-known actors, Pori Moni said she was stopped from inaugurating a department store in the northern town of Tangail after reported objections from religious groups. ""Now I'm really feeling helpless, as well as insecure. It's part of my job to take part in opening a showroom or a similar event. No one has stopped me all these years,"" Ms Moni told the BBC Bengali service. Similar events involving two other actors, Apu Biswas and Mehazabien Chowdhury, have also been cancelled following threats by Islamists. Minority groups like the Sufi Muslims say they are also witnessing increasing attacks on their places of worship. Islamist extremists view Sufism as heretical. ""About a hundred of our shrines [mazars] and centres have been attacked in the past six months,"" Anisur Rahman Jafri, Secretary General of the Sufism Universal Foundation, told the BBC. ""We have not seen this kind of sudden extremist attack on us since the country's independence in 1971,"" he added, warning that the country was at risk of ""Talibanisation"" if the situation continued. Police said only 40 shrines were damaged and that they had stepped up security around religious sites. The authorities have also been struggling to maintain law and order in the wake of Sheikh Hasina's departure. Earlier this month, thousands of protesters vandalised homes and buildings connected to Hasina and senior leaders of her Awami League party. People from other groups and parties, including Islamists, joined in other demonstrations in the capital, Dhaka, and across the country. The authorities have defended the security forces for not intervening, saying doing so would have cost lives. Rights groups have expressed concern over the security situation. ""If the government fails to act, then Islamists are going to feel emboldened. There will be more self-censorship for women and girls, they will be more intimidated participating in public events,"" Shireen Huq, a prominent women's rights activist, told the BBC. ""I am still optimistic that this phenomenon will not sustain,"" she added.

,,,reliable,,"Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications. But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots. The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months. A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently. After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users. Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table – committing $3bn (£2.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's ""unmatched"" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential. With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too. But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say. China and the US already have a ""four to five year head-start"", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC. Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index – which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research – India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas. China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent. India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023. India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030. While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of ""patient"" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations. ""Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it."" Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity. But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent – with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country. The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country. This is partly because ""foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs"", Mr Bindra says. And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors. The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code. Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies. ""It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill,"" says Mr Roy. He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence. ""I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years,"" he adds. It is a view many others share. India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek ""to leapfrog our own AI progress"", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X. In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts. India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet. Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully.",,,,India seeks AI breakthrough - but is it falling behind?,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, @Nik_inamdar",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Japan says it will increase its reliance on nuclear energy in a major policy shift as it seeks to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors. An energy plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday called for ""maximising the use of nuclear energy"" and dropped reference to ""reducing reliance on nuclear energy"". The energy plan, written by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry says that by 2040, nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan's grid supply in 2040, more than double the 8.5% share in 2023. It comes as the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster from 14 years ago continues to hang over the country, conjuring painful memories. In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Japan's north-east coast spawned a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people, wiping out entire towns and flooding the reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japan now operates 14 commercial nuclear reactors, compared to 54 before the Fukushima disaster when 30% of the country's energy was from nuclear sources. The plan still needs approval by parliament, where it will be discussed in the coming months. The country, which imports 90% of its fuel, needs to look to nuclear sources as part of its plan to cut back on carbon and be self-reliant on energy, said Daishiro Yamagiwa, an MP who was part of a government advisory committee on the energy plan. ""Because of the conflict in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, even fossil fuels have become difficult to buy,"" he told the BBC. ""Japan is a country without energy resources, so we must use whatever is available in a balanced way."" Yamagiwa added that energy burdens are growing because of demand from AI data processing centres and semiconductor factories around the country. But experts say increasing reliance on nuclear energy will be both risky and costly. Japan will need to import uranium, which is expensive and will make the country reliant on other countries, said Professor Kenichi Oshima at the faculty of policy science at Ryukoku University. Prof Oshima told the BBC the main concern is that increasing the number of nuclear power plants also raises the risk of potentially disastrous accidents. He cited the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake in the Noto peninsula, where two decades ago, a plan to build a nuclear plant was scrapped because locals opposed it. ""If there had been a nuclear power plant there, it is quite clear that it would have caused a major accident,"" he said. In Japan, any mention of nuclear energy inevitably brings back difficult memories of the nuclear meltdown at the Daiichi power plant. ""We all had such a terrible experience at the time of the Fukushima quake,"" Tokyo resident Yuko Maruyama told the BBC. ""How could I support it [the nuclear energy plan]? I want the government to rely on other sources of energy,"" she added. ""As a mother I think of the children, of their safety. I cannot help but think about what would happen in the future."" The meltdown at Fukushima is considered the world's worst since that of Chernobyl in 1986. It stirred fresh controversy in 2023, when Japan started releasing treated water from the site of the Fukushima plant. This drew protests from Japan's neighbours, including China, over safety concerns. The United Nations atomic energy regulator IAEA said the waste water was safe and would have a ""negligible"" impact on people and the environment. In response to the new energy plan announced this week, Greenpeace said promoting nuclear energy is ""outrageous"" when the fallout from Fukushima is still ongoing. ""There is no justification for continuing to rely on nuclear energy, which remains toxic for tens of thousands of years, produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management, and carries risks like earthquakes and terrorism,"" the group said. To meet the government's goal, experts say 33 reactors must be put back online, but the current pace of safety checks as well as residents' objections in some areas will make this difficult. Many of these nuclear plants are old and will need to be refitted with new technology for them to function safely. ""That most difficult problem is that each nuclear power plant is in a different location and will need its own safety protocol and infrastructure,"" Yamagiwa said. ""We must check each of them carefully. It still takes time."" In recent months, regulators have given several old reactors approval to keep operating. In October 2024 Japan's oldest reactor, Takahama nuclear power plant, was given the go-ahead to continue operations, making it the first reactor in the country to get approval to operate beyond 50 years.",,,,Japan to increase reliance on nuclear energy in post-Fukushima shift,"Shaimaa Khalil, Tokyo correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Depending on how you read it, New Zealand's latest tourism tagline can be a well-meaning plea for people to visit - or a threat to kick Kiwis out. ""Everyone Must Go!"" reads a slogan printed across posters of people in New Zealand's majestic landscapes - part of a NZ$500,000 ($285,000; £227,000) campaign unveiled on Sunday. But what was meant as a catchy call to action aimed at Australian tourists has been accused of being tone-deaf, as New Zealand deals with record emigration rates and unemployment. The government has defended the campaign, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying he ""[appreciates] there's lots of chat about whether everyone loves the slogan or not"". ""The fact that we're talking about it is a good thing. It's a great thing,"" he added. Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told local news outlet Radio New Zealand (RNZ) that the new slogan ""makes New Zealand sound like we're in a clearance bin at a sale"". ""The irony of that messaging is, that's how Aotearoa New Zealanders are feeling right now,"" she said, pointing to the ""many cuts"" that residents have experienced. Job cuts to the public sector over the past year, as part of the government's austerity push, have affected thousands of people. Meanwhile, people are moving out of the country in record numbers. Official figures show that there were nearly 130,000 departures last year - though that was offset by the arrival of nearly 160,000 immigrants. ""New Zealanders are voting with their feet, leaving in record high numbers,"" Labour MP Barbara Edmonds wrote on X on Monday. ""Is their real tourism plan 'Everyone Must Go' - for Kiwis?"" Others associated the slogan with demand for lavatories. ""I think 'Everyone Must Go' might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous,"" Green Party MP Celia Wade-Brown told RNZ. ""They don't go kayaking, they don't go diving, but, my goodness, they queue at the toilets."" Tourism minister Louise Upston said in a statement on Sunday that ""the campaign tagline of 'Everyone must go' lets Australia know that New Zealand is a 'must visit' destination, and that we're ready and waiting to welcome them now"". New Zealand's tourism numbers have yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, and authorities are channelling efforts into attracting visitors from neighbouring Australia, its largest source of tourists. Last year, New Zealand welcomed more than 1.2 million visitors from Australia. But Upston said visitors numbers were only 88% of that in 2019. Luxon said he hoped the latest campaign would boost Australian visitor numbers by 5%. ""It would be totally and utterly tragic if those Australians don't get here before they do die,"" he said.

,,,reliable,,"A couple in north-east Pakistan has been detained on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked for them as a maid, for allegedly stealing chocolates. The girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured. The case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers. Laws pertaining to child labour can vary across the country, but children under the age of 15 cannot be employed as domestic workers in the province of Punjab. ""I felt completely shattered inside when she died,"" Iqra's father, Sana Ullah, told the BBC. He said that he had received a call from the police about Iqra last Wednesday. When he rushed to the hospital, he saw Iqra lying on a bed, unconscious. She died minutes later. Iqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt. After working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about £23 ($28) per month. Police said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured. Police also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head. An autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report. ""My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?"" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. ""How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?"" Others have pointed out that her murder was allegedly triggered by something so minor. ""She died over chocolate?"" asked one Pakistani user on X. ""This is not just a crime, it's a reflection of [a] system that enables [the] rich to treat [the] poor as disposable,"" another said. Iqra's employers, Rashid Shafiq and his wife Sana, have been arrested, along with a Quran teacher, who worked for the family. The teacher had brought Iqra to the hospital and left after telling hospital staff that the girl's father had died and her mother was not around. Police told the BBC it was unclear if she believed this to be the truth. Iqra's father says he wants to see ""those responsible for my daughter's death punished"". Despite the public outrage such cases usually garner, they are typically settled out of court and it's rare for suspects to be successfully prosecuted. In 2018, a judge and his wife were sentenced to three years in jail for torturing their then 10-year-old maid in what had been a highly publicised case that sparked outrage across the country. But they later had their sentences reduced to one year. Tayyaba was found with severe injuries, which the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science said included burns to her hands and feet. Pictures of the girl also showed cuts and bruising to her face, along with a swollen left eye. She told prosecutors she was beaten for losing a broom. Under Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes. To do so, they have to state in court that they forgive a suspect ""in the name of God"". In reality, legal observers say that the primary motive for that ""forgiveness"" is normally financial, and paying victims is not illegal. About 3.3 million children in Pakistan are engaged in child labour, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). Moreover, women and young girls make up the vast majority of Pakistan's 8.5 million domestic workers, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).",,,,'Died for stealing chocolate': Pakistan anger over death of child maid,"Azadeh Moshiri, Pakistan correspondent, Usman Zahid, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has been found guilty of lying under oath to a parliamentary committee. A court imposed the maximum fine of S$7,000 ($5,223; £4,148) for each of two charges. Singh said that he would appeal against the conviction and sentence. The charges relate to Singh's handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party, who lied to parliament in a separate case. The verdict in this high-profile trial comes as Singapore is gearing up for its next general election, which must be held by November. Singh's Workers' Party holds nine out of 87 elected seats in parliament. Under Singapore's constitution, any MP can lose their seat or be barred from running for office for five years if they are fined at least S$10,000 or jailed for more than a year. The election department has since clarified that the S$10,000 threshold only applies to a single offence, according to local media. This means Singh's fines will not trigger disqualification. ""The question on most people's minds is the consequences for the upcoming election,"" Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC. Singh's case could either be ""played up"" by state media or ""fizzle out"" of public attention, he said. Singh told reporters outside the court on Monday that he intended to run in the upcoming election. The verdict on Monday, which lasted more than two hours, was delivered to a packed courtroom. Members of the press who could not fit into the courtroom, including the BBC, viewed a livestream of the verdict from a separate room. District Judge Luke Tan, who delivered the verdict, said several pieces of evidence showed that Singh ""never wanted Ms Khan to clarify [her] lie"" and had ""direct and intimate involvement"" in guiding Khan to continue her narrative. Prosecutors sought the maximum fine of S$7,000 for each of Singh's two charges, while the defence asked for S$4,000. Singh, 48, maintained his innocence throughout the trial, arguing that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue. Singh's case has gripped the city-state, where a usually uneventful political scene - dominated by the ruling People's Action Party - has in recent years seen a rare string of scandals. The saga started in August 2021 when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true. Khan was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. She has since resigned from the party and parliament. During a parliamentary committee investigation into the incident later that year, Khan testified that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to ""continue with the narrative"" despite finding out that it was not true. This was prior to her eventual admission. Singh denied this, but also said that he had given Khan ""too much time to settle herself before closing this issue with her"". The parliamentary committee concluded that Singh was not being truthful and referred the case to the public prosecutor. Judge Tan said on Monday that Singh's actions after learning of Khan's lie were ""strongly indicative that the accused did not want Ms Khan to clarify the untruth at some point"". Singh's Workers' Party is the opposition party with the largest presence in parliament. The party made significant gains during the 2020 election, increasing their number of seats from six to 10 - the biggest victory for the opposition since Singapore gained independence in 1965. Singh was named the opposition leader after the polls. One of those seats has since been vacated by Khan.

,,,reliable,,"UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time. UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban. The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications. Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question. The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK. The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present. The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence. BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units. The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials. The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge. Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed. Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were ""extremely concerning"". ""There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,"" Martin said. ""If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,"" he added. Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard ""horrific"" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces. Mercer said it was ""very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry"". The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as ""credible"" evidence of service with the Triples units. The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD. Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country. ""Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,"" said a former Triples officer. ""The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,"" he said. The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces ""like brothers"" and felt ""betrayed"" by the widespread rejections. ""If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,"" he said. The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope. The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan. ""Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,"" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn. ""As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at."" Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections. In court filings, they criticised the ""total inadequacy"" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an ""an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation"" of the process. New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship. The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role ""evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior"". But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014. ""Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,"" said former officer who served with UKSF. ""We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,"" he said.",,,,"Special Forces rejected 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms","Hannah O'Grady, Joel Gunter, and Rory Tinman, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"On Sunday morning, the New Delhi Railway Station in India's capital looked much like it always does: bustling, with its many platforms full of eager, impatient passengers waiting to catch their trains. But on Saturday night, a deadly crush - reportedly caused by overcrowding - killed at least 18 people and left several injured. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj city where the massive Hindu religious festival, Kumbh Mela, is being held - was waiting to depart as people pushed against each other. The crush occurred after ""a passenger slipped and fell on the stairs"", a spokesperson for Indian Railways said. Opposition leaders have criticised the government, alleging that Indian Railways did not make adequate arrangements to manage crowds at the station. An investigation has been launched, and authorities have announced compensation for the victims. When asked by the BBC about safety and security at the station, Pankaj Gangwar, Principal Chief Security Commissioner of Northern Railway, said ""let the investigation be completed first"". Crushes like these are not unheard of in India, where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. Last month, 30 people were killed and dozens injured in a crush at the Kumbh Mela. Crowds at the railway station were also not unexpected - trains are by far the cheapest long-distance mode of transport in India and it is common for the number of passengers to far exceed the capacity of trains. Eyewitnesses and the families of victims have been recounting their ordeal. Many of them were angry at authorities and police officials at the railway station, who they say did not act in time. Some eyewitnesses said the crush was not limited to one place but took place on the overhead bridge, staircases and platforms. Bipin Jha was at the station to meet his wife Mamta, who was arriving on a train. She died in the crush. ""I met her at the platform and we were walking on the footbridge overhead when she was trapped in the crush. She died in front of my eyes. I will live my life with the guilt of not saving her,"" he says. ""We were on the stairs, suddenly we felt a push from behind. We fell, along with many others, and were trapped under bodies. I was barely breathing,"" said Seema, whose sister-in law Pinky Devi died on the staircase. Usha Devi, who was travelling to the eastern state of Bihar for her nephew's wedding, said chaos erupted the moment she reached the platform. ""Many people fell. Everywhere, there were scattered belongings, food items and clothes. I was on the verge of fainting. So many people were collapsing. The crowd was so dense that we couldn't board our train."" Umesh Giri's wife Shilam Devi was among the victims. ""The crowd became uncontrollable,"" he told BBC Hindi while waiting outside the mortuary at Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College. ""I saw several bodies already lying there. People were colliding with each other, and others started falling over them,"" said Mr Giri, who was also injured. He added that help took time to arrive and that he pleaded with officers for help. Senior police and railway officials at the scene did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Most of the victims were taken to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital in New Delhi, where police and paramilitary forces were deployed, and railway authorities had set up a help desk to assist families. Journalists were not allowed to enter the hospital on Saturday. Relatives of victims shared their grief with reporters waiting outside, while also expressing anger at the facilities in the hospital. ""Multiple people were crammed onto a single bed,"" alleged Shobha, the sister-in-law of Shilam Devi. Others coming out of the hospital also confirmed this. Hospital authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. At Lady Hardinge Hospital, the grieving family of Riya, 7, completed the paperwork so they could receive her body.

Thousands of people reportedly crammed into the railway station on Saturday night as they tried to board delayed trains.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his thoughts were ""with all those who have lost their loved ones"" in a post on X. Crowd crushes are common in India where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. The incident comes weeks after 30 people were killed in a pre-dawn crush at the religious festival, Kumbh Mela, in northern India, where tens of millions of Hindus had gathered to bathe in sacred river waters on one of the holy days of the six-week event. In Delhi, witnesses told BBC Hindi that a ""huge crowd"" had gathered at the station, through which many people were travelling to and from the Kumbh Mela, which is being held in Prayagraj city in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state. Hundreds of people were also waiting for trains to other places. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj - was waiting to depart. Ruby Devi said the crowd at the Indian capital's main railway station had been so big she was unable to get inside.

The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($128,000; £102,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad. ""I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,"" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. ""But I've ended up with a bounty!"" Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago. In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels. Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest. Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11. ""It freaked me out at first,"" she says, but then she fired back a public response. ""I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."" Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997. ""Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity,"" she said. She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck. ""I was so shocked,"" she says. ""That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."" Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about ""what we like and don't like"" and ""could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like"". But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge. ""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says. But when things started to get ""really crazy"", she browbeat her parents into coming with her. At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the ""raw experience"", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV. After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. The authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and has not weakened the city's autonomy. But most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were suddenly gone. Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail. In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown. At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around. Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO. When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians.

,,,reliable,,"Warning: This report contains some disturbing details An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced ""unnatural sex"" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women. The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it. Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault. The lower court had also found the man guilty of ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder"". He was sentenced to ""rigorous imprisonment for 10 years"" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently. But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act. The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. ""To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,"" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan. ""An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,"" she told the BBC. ""It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly."" Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this ""sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder"". She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. ""This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died."" The court documents make for grim reading. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, ""committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will… causing her a lot of pain"". After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later. In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill ""due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband"". A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence. While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated ""the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation"" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum. Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently – he questioned the ""sanctity"" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India. The lower court's conviction was ""a rarest of rare case"", Ms Shukla said, ""probably because the woman died"". ""But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge."" Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly. India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence. A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860. The British colonial-era law mentions several ""exemptions"" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is ""by a man with his own wife"" if she is not under 15 years. Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book. The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is ""implied"" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it. But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape. The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be ""excessively harsh"". The federal home ministry said it ""may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage"". Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency. ""A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,"" Ms Chauhan said. ""But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?"" she asks. Violence within marriage is rampant in India. According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% of married women, aged 18-49, who have experienced sexual violence said their current husbands were the perpetrators. And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame. ""In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,"" the lawyer said. Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes. ""We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out."" She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a ""man versus woman debate"". ""But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?""",,,,India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died,"Geeta Pandey, BBC News, London•@geetapandeybbc, •",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country. The properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board. The new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion. On 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders. They claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation. The new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community. But several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God. A vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon. The tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India. The properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. The government says that the waqf boards are among India’s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; £11.26bn). Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. But critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies – which too requires immediate attention. A report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. The committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; £1.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees. The committee also noted that “encroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common”, listing hundreds of instances of such “unauthorised occupation” of waqf land by government authorities. According to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown. The amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties. But many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism. One of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board. Many of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago. The 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of “waqf by user”, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain.",,,,Why Muslims in India are opposing changes to a property law,"Meryl Sebastian & Neyaz Farooquee, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The Indian government has brought the troubled north-eastern state of Manipur under direct federal rule days after Chief Minister N Biren Singh resigned. Singh, from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit on Sunday after facing months of pressure to step down. Ethnic clashes broke out between the state's majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in May 2023 over economic benefits, land rights and job quotas. More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict and tens of thousands displaced. The state hit the global headlines in July 2023 when a video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob went viral, sparking outrage in India. While the scale of unrest has reduced since the peak in 2023, divisions between the communities persist and violent incidents continue to occur. Singh's position had become increasingly untenable in recent months with Kuki groups accusing him of favouring the Meitei community, of which he is a member - an accusation he denied. Media reports said there was also rising discontent against him within the BJP. BJP leaders tried but failed to agree on someone to replace him as chief minister. On Thursday evening, the office of President Droupadi Murmu announced that federal rule - known as President's rule in India - had been imposed in the state. ""After receiving a report from the governor and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,"" the statement said. Manipur's last assembly session was held in August and Monday was set to be the first day of the new session, but federally-appointed governor Ajay Bhalla released a statement declaring the session ""null and void"". Earlier, opposition Congress party members had said they would bring a no-confidence motion against the chief minister during the session. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told the ANI news agency that Singh resigned as he sensed the motion would be passed. Ramesh called for federal Home Minister Amit Shah to resign. Opposition leaders have also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has not visited the state since the violence began. Meanwhile India's Supreme Court is hearing a plea against Singh filed by a Kuki organisation which accuses him of playing a direct role in fuelling the violence. The petitioners have submitted leaked audio tapes to back up their claims. The court has sought a forensic report on the tapes before the next hearing. Singh has denied any wrongdoing. The conflict involves the state's two largest ethnic groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, and their battle over land and influence. Tensions boiled over in May 2023 when Kukis began protesting against demands from the Meiteis to be given official tribal status. The Kukis argued this would strengthen the Meiteis' already strong influence on government and society, allowing them to buy land or settle in predominantly Kuki areas. But there are myriad underlying reasons. The Kukis say a war on drugs waged by the Meitei-led government is a screen to uproot their communities. Since the violence, Manipur has been divided into two camps, with Meiteis inhabiting the Imphal Valley and the Kukis living in the surrounding hill areas. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces and community members separate the two regions. Efforts to hold peace talks between the communities by federal and state officials have so far failed to end the conflict.",,,,Direct rule in violence-hit Indian state after chief minister quits,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Delhi",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"More than 250 people from 20 nationalities who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmar's Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand. The workers, almost all of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking. Last week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border. Her government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash. Some opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years. Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar. The scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese. They are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as ""pig butchering"" and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling. Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured. The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State. These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds. The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948. On Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. The warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams. The BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that ""online businesses"" should leave. But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one. Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military. Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories. The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. They included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia.",,,,Hundreds of foreigners freed from Myanmar's scam centres,"Jonathan Head, South East Asia Correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers. The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her. ""After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,"" Smitha says. She was eventually paid – a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; £9] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes – after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action. Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon. Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse. But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed. Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented. Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the ""most comprehensive policies for domestic workers"" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it. As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million. ""We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,"" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies. ""This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work."" As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes. At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope. But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges. Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers. ""We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,"" she says. That applies to employers too. ""They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,"" Ms George says. The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not. Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. ""Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,"" she adds. In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 – a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions. India has a ""moral obligation"" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work. Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict. Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests. ""At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,"" she says. ""So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset.""

While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future. Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations.

,,,reliable,,"Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her government tried to cling on to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters that could amount to ""crimes against humanity"", the UN has said. UN human rights investigators accused the deposed government of a brutal response to mass opposition last year, in which they said up to 1,400 people had been killed, mostly by security forces. The UN team said ""an official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters"" had been directed by political leaders and senior security officials. Hasina, who had been in office for 15 years, fled by helicopter to India shortly before crowds stormed her residence last August. The unrest began as student-led protests against quotas in civil service jobs and escalated into a countrywide movement to oust Hasina and her Awami League party following a deadly police crackdown. Thousands more were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971. The UN investigators' findings show the then government, including Sheikh Hasina, ""were aware of and involved in very serious offences"", UN human rights chief Volker Türk told a news conference in Geneva. ""Among our key findings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations,"" Mr Türk said. The UN investigators documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture. Children, too, were targeted – the report estimates up to 13% of the 1,400 people killed between between 1 July and 15 August were children. ""The brutal response was a calculated and well-co-ordinated strategy by the former government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition,"" Mr Türk said. He said the evidence gathered by his office painted ""a disturbing picture of rampant state violence and targeted killings"". ""There are reasonable grounds to believe hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture, were carried out with the knowledge, co-ordination and direction of the political leadership and senior security officials as part of a strategy to suppress the protests."" The report was requested by Bangladesh's caretaker leader, Muhammad Yunus, who said he and his interim government remained ""committed to transforming Bangladesh into a country in which all its people can live in security and dignity"". The overall number of deaths given by the UN team is far higher than the 834 most recently estimated by his government. The UN team that compiled the report included human rights investigators, a forensics physician and a weapons expert. Their findings are mainly based on more than 230 interviews with survivors, witnesses and others. They were given access to medical case files, photos, videos and other material. ""Former senior officials directly involved in handling the protests and other inside sources described how the former prime minister and other senior officials directed and oversaw a series of large-scale operations, in which security and intelligence forces shot and killed protesters or arbitrarily arrested and tortured them,"" the report said. It ""found patterns of security forces deliberately and impermissibly killing or maiming protesters, including incidents where people were shot at point-blank range"". Mohammad Ali Arafat, a former minister in Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tasked wth negotiating with demonstrators, rejected the report's findings, saying it was ""preposterous"" to suggest she had ordered protest leaders to be killed. ""The problem with relying on 'testimonies' from unnamed security officials at this time is their utter unreliability,"" he told the BBC. ""These security officials, who themselves are in the dock for the alleged rights violations, would naturally point fingers at whoever the current government in Bangladesh wants to implicate. ""The UN would be mistaken to rely on such 'cut-throat' defences."" While the report attributes most of the violence to government security forces, it also raises concerns about attacks on those perceived to be supporters of the former government, and against some religious and ethnic groups. These must be investigated too, the UN Human Rights Office said.

,,,reliable,,"A truck cabin that was swallowed by a sinkhole in Japan two weeks ago has been located in a nearby sewer pipe, authorities say. Drone images suggest that a human body is inside the cabin, but it is unclear if it is that of the truck's missing 74-year-old driver. The sinkhole, which now measures 40m (131ft) in diameter, opened at a road intersection in Yashio city near Tokyo. It is believed to be caused by a sewer rupture. Search teams are unable to enter the 5m-wide pipe due to continuous water flow and high levels of hydrogen sulfide or sewer gas, officials said. They will need to install a temporary bypass pipe to stop the water flow and access the truck. That process could take three months, Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said. While rescuers were able to pull the truck's loading platform from the sinkhole, they were unable to reach the cabin which had the driver. The driver was able to communicate with rescuers shortly after he fell into the sinkhole on 28 January, but contact was lost as the truck was buried deeper in soil and debris. On Sunday, authorities moved their search from the sinkhole to the nearby sewer pipe, where part of a driver's seat was found. The sinkhole initially measured 10m wide and 5m deep, but it has since quadrupled in size after it merged with another sinkhole nearby. As the crater continues to erode, authorities have asked nearby residents to evacuate their homes, fearing further cave-ins. Officials have also asked 1.2 million residents in Saitama prefecture to reduce their water usage, including cutting back on showers and laundry, to limit the water flowing in the underground pipes. The water flow and further road collapses have hampered the search operation, which was suspended more than once out of safety concerns. Sinkholes are increasingly common in Japanese cities, as many have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure. Officials say that it could take two or three years to repair the sewer rupture.",,,,Japan truck found in pipe weeks after falling in sinkhole,"Koh Ewe, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government. Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety. But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality. One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had ""mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings"". The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population. The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals. This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system. Zheng Minhua cited ""antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep"" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered. Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs. ""I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand,"" one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had ""no effect whatsoever"", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel. The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them. A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the ""original"" ""real"" one, since the generic version ""tasted different"". ""There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying,"" the user warned. Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom.

,,,reliable,,"Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. Starting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings. The collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dalí's friend and publisher. ""Dalí was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,"" Ms Argillet told the BBC. Some of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests. Dalí's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. In his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. ""Appreciating Dalí's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,"" Ms Argillet says. Bringing Dalí's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition. ""The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,"" Ms Aggarwal says. Strictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dalí's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist. In 1967, Dalí famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers. In return, Dalí demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed. She finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dalí had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out). Dalí's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality. Born in Spain in 1904, Dalí grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and André Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dalí. The surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by André Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was ""dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason"", according to Breton. Dalí was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges. Consequently, Dalí's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. ""Dalí was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,"" Ms Argillet says. The artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dalí revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache. ""Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,"" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache. In the same interview, he described his moustache as being ""very gay, very pointed, very aggressive"". Ms Argillet, who knew Dalí intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dalí being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and ""shocking the bourgeois"". He once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover. ""At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,"" Ms Argillet says. But she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dalí's shyness that made him over-perform in public. ""He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dalí, just like his paintings,"" Ms Argillet says. ""The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dalí."" The exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March.

,,,reliable,,"Instances of hate speech against minorities jumped 74% in India in 2024, peaking during the country's national elections, according to a new report. The report, released on Monday by Washington-based research group India Hate Lab, documented 1,165 such instances last year, adding that politicians like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were among the most frequent purveyors of hate speech. Muslims were targeted the most, with 98.5% of recorded instances of hate speech directed against them. The report said most of the events where hate speech occurred were held in states governed by Modi's party or larger alliance. The BBC has sought comment on the India Hate Lab report from several spokespersons at Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Over the years, BJP leaders have often been accused of targeting India's minority communities, especially Muslims. The ruling party has rejected allegations of Islamophobia and hate speech levelled at it by rights groups and opposition leaders. On Tuesday, its national spokesperson reiterated this stance, telling CNN that the country had a ""very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost"". ""Today's India does not need any certification from any 'anti-India reports industry' which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India's image,"" Jaiveer Shergill said. But the party was accused of using hate speech during the heated election campaign last year. The prime minister himself was accused of using divisive rhetoric that attacked Muslims. In May, India's Election Commission also asked the party to remove a social media post that opposition leaders said ""demonised Muslims"". According to the India Hate Lab report, 269 hate speech instances were reported in May 2024, the highest in the year. Christians have also been targeted by hate speech, but to a lesser extent than Muslims, the report says. Rights groups have often said that minorities, especially Muslims, have faced increased discrimination and attacks after Modi's government came to power in 2014. The BJP has repeatedly denied these allegations. The lab's report said that hate speech was especially observed at political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings. Most of these events - 931 or 79.9% - took place in states where the BJP directly governed or ruled in coalition. Three BJP-ruled states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh - accounted for nearly half of the total hate speech events recorded in 2024, the lab's data showed. The ruling party was also the organiser for 340 such events in 2024, a 580% increase from the previous year. ""Hate speech patterns in 2024 also revealed a deeply alarming surge in dangerous speech compared to 2023, with both political leaders and religious figures openly inciting violence against Muslims,"" the report said. ""This included calls for outright violence, calls to arms, the economic boycott of Muslim businesses, the destruction of Muslim residential properties and the seizing or demolition of Muslim religious structures.""",,,,"India sees huge spike in hate speech in 2024, says report","Meryl Sebastian, BBC News, Kochi",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"New Zealand has accused the Cook Islands government of a lack of transparency over its plans to strike a partnership deal with China. The tiny Pacific Island nation's leader, Mark Brown, is this week making his country's first ever state visit to Beijing in order to sign the agreement. However, New Zealand says it was not properly consulted over the plans, leading to what Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described as a ""dispute"". The Cook Islands is hugely reliant on New Zealand under a longstanding ""free association"" agreement that provides it with defence and financial support. China's growing influence in the Pacific has challenged the US and its allies, who have held sway for years. ""We value our partnership with New Zealand and we expect the same respect,"" Brown said at a press conference last week. He was due to travel to China on Monday. ""Disagreements, although difficult, are an inevitable part of international relations but they should never define the entirety of our engagement."" He has denied any dispute, saying ""engagement has been consistent, respectful and open"" and that the Cook Islands has the right to forge its own path as a self-governing country. China's foreign ministry said that both countries were important partners and that it was ready to work with the Cook Islands to ""achieve new progress"". ""The China-Cook Islands relationship is not targeted at any third party and should not be subject to or be disrupted by any third party,"" said spokesman Guo Jiakun. Beijing has had diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands since 1997 and is one of its development partners. Under their 60-year-old agreement, the Cook Islands is self governing in ""free association"" with New Zealand. The two countries are expected to consult each other over issues of defence and security. Brown says the new agreement with China will cover areas including infrastructure, trade and tourism. Deep deep-sea mining is also expected to be part of the deal. Brown believes that mining valuable minerals on the seabed could be a game-changer for the Cook Islands, creating huge economic wealth. However, the practice, in which China is a major player, is controversial, and critics believe it will exacerbate climate change - to which the Cook Islands are already vulnerable. Luxon said on Monday that while New Zealand had ""very good relations between the Cook Islands and its people"", in this case there had not been transparency. Asked at a press conference whether he would consider putting aid to the Cook Islands on hold, as it recently did for Kiribati due to a diplomatic snub, Luxon said he would wait to see what was in the deal. Under the free association agreement Cook Islanders can live, work and access healthcare as New Zealand citizens - benefits some fear they could lose if relations between the two countries further sour. There has also been criticism from some that Brown and his government did not consult the public about the China deal first - something Tina Browne, the leader of the Democratic Party, has described as ""insane"". Both she and fellow opposition leader Teariki Heather, from the Cook Islands United Party, say they have lost confidence in Brown's leadership. That is despite his recent U-turn on a controversial proposal to introduce a separate passport for Cook Island citizens, while also allowing them to retain New Zealand citizenship. Wellington rejected the plan last year. The Cook Islands is not the first Pacific Island nation to strengthen its ties with China.

""It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context,"" reads one review on IMDB. Some hope it could earn another $1bn and surpass the world's highest-grossing film of all time, 2009's Avatar. ""Now it's over to the Chinese people overseas to chip in,"" read one comment on Weibo. Movie ticket sales in China surge during the Lunar New Year festivities. This season saw Chinese films rake in $1.3b during the weeklong holiday period, underscoring an increase in consumer spending that Chinese authorities have been hoping for. Aside from setting a new box-office benchmark in China, Ne Zha 2 is also the first movie ever to cross $1bn in a single market, according to Hollywood publication Deadline. Ne Zha 2 has been praised for its script and visual effects. Figurines of the movie's characters have flown off the shelves as fans flock to cinemas. It builds on the success of the 2019 film Ne Zha, which made more than $725m and is China's fifth highest-grossing film of all time.",,,,"Chinese film stirs national pride, rakes in $1bn in days","Koh Ewe, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Indian security forces have killed 31 Maoist rebels in the forests of Chhattisgarh state. Two Indian commandos were also killed in the battle, and two other security force members were wounded, police said. Chhattisgarh has seen a long-running insurgency by Maoists who say they are fighting for the rights of the poor. Sunday's clashes were among the deadliest clashes since the government ramped up efforts to crush the insurgency, which has been running since the 1960s. ""So far 31 dead bodies of the Maoists have been recovered,"" senior police officer Sundarraj Pattilingam said. The death toll could rise as police carry out operations in the area, he said. Police said they had seized assault rifles and grenade launchers from the bodies of the dead rebels. The clashes took place in the forests of Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh. Amit Shah, India's interior minister, who says the government expects to crush the rebellion by 2026, said the operation had been a ""big success"". The rebels are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They claim to be fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor. The insurgency began in West Bengal state in the late 1960s and has since spread to more than a third of India's 600 districts. The rebels control large areas of several states in a ""red corridor"" stretching from north-east to central India. Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen. But clashes between security forces and rebels are still common, killing scores of people every year. A crackdown by security forces killed around 287 rebels last year - the vast majority in Chhattisgarh - according to government data.

,,,reliable,,"Australian authorities say a body has been found in floodwaters and 13 military workers injured in a vehicle crash as wild weather from a tropical storm lashes the country's eastern coast. Cyclone Alfred, which was downgraded to a tropical low on Saturday, made landfall near the Queensland capital city of Brisbane in the evening local time. Officials have warned residents to stay indoors and remain vigilant, saying the storm's threat is ""not over"". Winds have brought down trees and power lines and flooded low-lying roads. More than 300,000 properties are without power in the region. Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern New South Wales (NSW). Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away. Police found a body in the area on Saturday and said it ""is believed to be that of the missing man"". In a separate incident on Saturday, 13 military personnel were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, according to Federal Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh. One truck overturned while driving on a narrow road. A second truck then collided with it. The state's ambulance service had earlier said it treated 36 people in the accident. Keogh clarified to media that while around 36 people were involved, only 13 were injured. They had been part of military crews deployed to Lismore, near the Queensland border, to help rescue and response operations. ""Our ADF [Australian Defence Force] heroes were on their way to help Australians in need,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement noting some had been ""seriously"" injured. Albanese earlier on Saturday had addressed the nation from the capital Canberra, saying millions of residents were ""well-prepared"" but ""we must remain vigilant."" Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales were bracing for the storm's landfall with dozens of weather warnings in place across both areas. Around 287,000 customers are experiencing outages in south east Queensland, according to energy provider Energex, while Essential Energy said more than 42,600 homes and businesses in New South Wales had experienced blackouts. People in Brisbane, Queensland's capital, went to bed on Friday bracing for strong winds and heavy rain. They woke up on Saturday to learn that the cyclone had been downgraded and the city would escape the worst of the weather. But the danger's not over in other parts of southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Along the Gold Coast, pummelled by bad weather the past few days, conditions have been very strong with driving rain and strong winds. Hundreds of trees have been blown over in gardens, parks and along the main roads. There has been lots of debris and emergency services had sectioned off areas most at risk. ""This emergency is not over,"" said New South Wales state premier Chris Minns, adding that it was ""crucially important"" the public did not ""dismiss"" the storm. ""It really doesn't matter to us whether it's been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a weather event,"" he said. The state's emergency service operations commander, Stuart Fisher, warned people not to be ""complacent"" and said authorities in the region expect flooding to continue over the next few days. As the storm has edged closer to landfall, nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled. Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. The BBC spoke to several people from Brisbane's homeless community, who took refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, which had become a round-the-clock shelter. At the Treasure Island Holiday Park in the Gold Coast, just north of Surfer's Paradise, a gum tree had come down between two cabins, damaging a third. Nearby, a boat was half submerged in one of the canals a block away from the beach. On the coast itself, many paths down to the beach are now unpassable. Instead, there's a sudden drop to the ocean where the powerful waves have eaten away at the sand. But the clean-up operation won't happen for a few days – the wind is still powerful and there's driving rain. Residents are starting to venture out to look at the damage, but plenty are remaining indoors to keep themselves safe.

,,,reliable,,"Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been waiting anxiously as a tropical storm - downgraded from Cyclone Alfred - crawls towards them, leaving thousands in the dark. Four million people are in the firing line of what was thought to be the region's first tropical cyclone in 50 years. Tens of thousands were told to evacuate ahead of the storm, which is expected to make landfall on Saturday. Most have taken heed of warnings to stay indoors - taping up their windows and strapping down garden furniture - while shops have lined sandbags in front of their doors. Ex-cyclone Alfred's path slowed in recent days, with one meteorologist describing it as a ""walking pace"", which sparked fears of prolonged rain and flooding. In southern Brisbane, a popular city in Queensland, some from the homeless community have taken refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, filling the floor on rows of inflatable air mattresses. The space, usually a day centre for people needing a shower or a hot meal, has become a round-the-clock shelter. The BBC spoke to people at the centre when the tropical storm was still categorised as a cyclone. Operations manager Tim Noonan told the BBC that most government-funded charities in the inner city of Brisbane have shut down since Thursday, leaving limited options for those in need. It may be the first time in a long while that homeless people - who typically live in tents in parks or along riverbanks - have a proper resting space, he said. ""It's counter intuitive...but this is the best they've been looked after. They've got somewhere to sleep. ""For a lot of them, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an eight-hour sleep in air conditioning, going to bed on a full belly, waking up, getting a barista coffee and a bacon and egg burger,"" he said. Mr Noonan said he hoped the cyclone would highlight the need for better funding for organisations such as his. ""We'd love for when the cyclone passes, that these people don't become invisible again,"" he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second night at the centre with her dog Charcoal. ""I live on the streets, we have a housing crisis, and now we have a cyclone. This place has been amazing for finding other people who are doing it rough and getting information,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm not scared, but I am worried for others who are still on the streets."" While the authorities have warned for days about the cyclone, some die-hard surfers have instead seized the opportunity to ride the high waves. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said complacency is the biggest risk - especially as the arrival of what was then categorised as a cyclone, kept being pushed back. ""We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being asked to evacuate, but lots of people aren't going because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's hard to take that notice to evacuate seriously, perhaps, when the sun is still shining in your backyard,"" Wells told the BBC. Now a tropical storm, winds are set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast. On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Meteorology, warned of the ongoing risk of severe weather, explaining that ""24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days."" She told ABC News Breakfast that ""rain is still coming through in full force... [with] widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well."" Flash and riverine flooding is the biggest concern especially in low-lying areas. Some residents have been told they could be without power for days, with more than 230,000 households currently in the dark. Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.

,,,reliable,,"A tropical storm is expected to make landfall on Australia's eastern coast on Saturday morning as tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than 230,000 households left without power. Initially called Cyclone Alfred, the weather front was downgraded to a tropical low with winds set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology said the storm is currently sitting off Bribie Island and is moving slowly north, and expected to cross the mainland coast between the island and Maroochydore. Authorities are still warning people to stay indoors, with fines for those who visit beaches, as heavy rain and flooding is still expected. On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology, said there is an ongoing risk of widespread severe weather, especially rainfall. ""Our 24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days as that system slows and moves inland,"" she told ABC News Breakfast. ""The rain is still coming through in full force, and we're still seeing widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well,"" she added. The ex-tropical cyclone has already caused flooding which authorities fear could worsen over the weekend. New South Wales police said on Friday that one man was missing after his vehicle was swept into a fast-flowing river. Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales are in the firing line of the storm. But its slow progress, described by weather experts as ""walking pace"" and ""erratic"", has raised concerns of flash and riverine flooding in low-lying areas. Stephen Valentine and his wife, who live in Logan city south of Brisbane, have prepared some 30 litres of water, food for themselves and their pets, and set up ""protected rooms"" in their home situated away from windows. ""At the moment we are as prepared as we can be for something that none of us have been through... Nothing has come this far south across the south,"" said Mr Valentine, who grew up in the city. ""We would get the edge of a cyclone ever so often, but not to this level,"" he added. While Queensland isn't a stranger to cyclones – it's the most disaster-prone state in Australia – it's rare they come so far south. ""These are tough times, but Australians are tough people, and we are resilient people,"" said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, echoing the Gold Coast's acting Mayor Donna Gates, who has said Cyclone Alfred is a ""scary proposition"" for the region. Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Flights aren't expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled. The last time a cyclone hit was in 1974, when Wanda hit in January and then two months later, Zoe crossed the coast. Flooding though, is more common. In February 2022, thousands of homes were damaged along much of Australia's east after heavy rain. Authorities have been keen to prepare communities ahead of Cyclone Alfred. The council opened sandbag depots across the region to help residents protect their homes. ""It's surreal. We know it's coming, but it's very quiet,"" said Anthony Singh, a resident of the Brisbane suburb of West End. He waited for four hours on Wednesday to pick up sandbags to protect his home. Fellow resident Mark Clayton, helped to co-ordinate the sandbag collection, shovelling more than 140 tonnes of sand. ""I think people are a bit apprehensive,"" he says. ""Are the buildings going to stay up, are the roofs going to stay on? People expect a lot of trees to come down and to lose power for an extended period of time."" With supermarkets now shut and people mostly sheltering at home, there's a lot of uncertainty as Australians wait for the storm to hit. But some die-hard surfers have thrown caution to the increasing wind. ""This is what we look forward to,"" said surfer Jeff Weatherall as he waited for a jet ski to pick him up from Kirra beach and carry him into the big waves. ""This is the fifth day straight - I've done nothing but eat, sleep, surf and do it again."" Kirra beach is famous for its breakers and surfers have been busy this week seizing the strong winds. ""There are people that are going to lose their houses, but at the moment, you're taking the good of it all. This is just crazy surf,"" said surfer Donnie Neal. Meanwhile Albanese have warned people to take the cyclone warnings seriously. ""This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,"" he said. ""Please stay safe. Be sensible.""

,,,reliable,,"Police in Australia have charged a 17-year-old who got on a plane with a shotgun and ammunition. He was filmed being wrestled to the ground by passengers and crew as the aircraft prepared to take off from Avalon Airport, near Melbourne, carrying 160 people bound for Sydney on Thursday afternoon. Police believe the teenager got onto the airport tarmac by breaching a security fence, before climbing the front steps to the plane, where he was tackled to the ground near the front door. The 17-year-old - who has not been identified - was taken into custody and will appear in youth court to face eight charges. Among them are unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, endangering the flight's safety and creating a bomb hoax. Victoria Police said a bomb specialist had to be brought in to search a car and two bags which were located nearby. Footage published by Australian outlet 7News showed the suspect being restrained by a passenger, while a member of ground crew and a pilot removed a utility belt containing tools that the suspect was carrying. The pilot can also be seen kicking the shotgun away from the teen, who is wearing a fluorescent jacket. ""How is this possible?"" someone onboard can be heard saying in the footage. Victoria Police said the 17-year-old, who is from the nearby Ballarat area, was being held in custody. Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters that passengers had noticed the teen was carrying a gun as he climbed the steps up to the plane. ""The male was overpowered by three of the passengers, at least,"" he said. Supt Reid said the local force was in contact with counterterrorism police but that it was too early to establish a motive.

""Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup so it feels like the right time to make way. ""Test cricket remains a priority and I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home.

He also played a key role eight years later as Australia upset hots India to win the tournament for a sixth time. Smith finishes his ODI career with 5,800 runs, at an average of 43.28. His highest score of 164 came against New Zealand at the SCG in 2016. Matthew Henry, BBC Sport journalist in Dubai Smith gave no hint at retirement in his news conference after defeat by India, but this decision is no surprise.

Lithuanian rower Aurimas Mockus sounded a distress signal late on Friday after he was stranded by a cyclone, and surrounded by towering waves and strong winds packing up to 100 km/h (62 mph), local media reported. Authorities made radio contact with Mr Mockus the next day when he was about 740km east of Mackay, a city on Australia's east coast in the Coral Sea. By the time he was rescued on Monday morning, the 44-year-old had spent nearly five months alone at sea. Mr Mockus is getting medical treatment on an Australian warship, which will take him to Sydney, the Australian navy said. He was attempting to become one of few rowers who have crossed the Pacific alone and without stopping. Among them are Britons Peter Bird and John Beeden, who achieved the feat in 1983 and 2015 respectively, and Australian Michelle Lee in 2023. Mr Mockus started his 12,000km-long journey in October from San Diego in southern California. Brisbane was meant to be his destination.

,,,reliable,,"One of the world's most prolific blood donors - whose plasma saved the lives of more than two million babies - has died. James Harrison died in his sleep at a nursing home in New South Wales, Australia on 17 February, his family said on Monday. He was 88. Known in Australia as the man with the golden arm, Harrison's blood contained a rare antibody, Anti-D, which is used to make medication given to pregnant mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service who paid tribute to Harrison, said he had pledged to become a donor after receiving transfusions while undergoing a major chest surgery when he was 14. He started donating his blood plasma when he was 18 and continued doing so every two weeks until he was 81. In 2005, he had the world record for most blood plasma donated - a title he held until 2022 when he was overtaken by a man in the US. Harrison's daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father was ""very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain"". ""He always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,"" she said. Mellowship and two of Harrison's grandchildren are also recipients of anti-D immunisations. ""It made [James] happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,"" she said. Anti-D jabs protect unborn babies from a deadly blood disorder called haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn, or HDFN. The condition occurs at pregnancy when the mother's red blood cells are incompatible with that of their growing baby. The mother's immune system then sees the baby's blood cells as a threat and produces antibodies to attack them. This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death. Before anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died. It is unclear how Harrison's blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14. There are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood. Lifeblood has been working with Australia's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors. Researchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide. ""Creating a new therapy has long been a 'holy grail',"" Lifeblood's research director David Irving said.

The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats. Qatar Airways said it apologised for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"". The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight. In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died. Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded ""in no time"" when the woman collapsed, but that ""unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch"".

,,,reliable,,"The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022. Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month. The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a ""dangerous, highly manipulative individual"". Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years. Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated. Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court. Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"". Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals.

He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot. Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to ""mutually part ways"". In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to ""sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation"". The company said that it ""takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience."" ""Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,"" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement. Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks ""diminish the extraordinary achievements"" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023. During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup. ""You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls,"" Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts. ""All the infighting and all the friendship issues...

,,,reliable,,"Beloved Australian soap drama Neighbours has been cancelled again, two years after it was saved by Amazon MGM Studios. Without specifying a reason, Amazon confirmed the series will finish at the end of 2025 - 40 years and more than 9,000 episodes after its television debut. It was dropped by Channel 5 in 2022, but revived by Amazon for its streaming platforms just four months after a star-studded farewell episode watched by millions. The soap - which helped launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie - has long been a huge hit with Australian and UK audiences, and last year received its first Emmy nomination. A statement on the show's social media said the soap would be ""resting"" from December. ""Audiences all around the world have loved and embraced Neighbours for four decades and we are very proud of the huge success over the last two years,"" executive producer Jason Herbison wrote. ""We value how much the fans love Neighbours and we believe there are more stories of the residents of Ramsay Street to tell in the future,"" Mr Hebrison added, hinting that the producers will again hunt for a new backer.

,,,reliable,,"More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research. It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year. The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children. The regulator accused the apps of ""a lack of robust interventions"" for checking the ages of their users. The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube. Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions. For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children. In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason. It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force. ""The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,"" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant. Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users. In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram - took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. ""This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,"" said a TikTok spokesperson. ""Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision."" A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies. Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms. They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer. Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer. The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13. If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year. ""These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,"" the report's authors said.",,,,"Children routinely using social media, Australian regulator says","Graham Fraser, Technology Reporter",,,,,,,1

The woman from Pascoe Vale suburb is due in court on Wednesday, where it will be alleged that she targeted the two victims on 13 February because of their head coverings, local media report. She allegedly grabbed and choked a 30-year-old pregnant woman using the latter's hijab at Epping shopping centre before pushing and slapping another 26-year-old woman in a separate assault 10 minutes later. This comes two weeks after the country passed tough new laws against hate crimes following a recent string of high-profile antisemitic attacks. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday condemned the incident as ""reprehensible"". He rejected criticism that his government was taking Islamophobic attacks less seriously compared to antisemitic attacks. ""I take all attacks on people on the basis of their faith seriously, and they should all face the full force of the law,"" he told reporters. Melbourne police say they are investigating reports of online threats against one of the two victims in the shopping centre. Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries. On Tuesday, Australia's anti-Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that ""all forms of hate need to stop"" and that the country's leaders must condemn the incident in Melbourne. Earlier in the week, the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Rateb Jneid, expressed alarm over attacks on Muslims in the country and called the government's response ""grossly insufficient"". Australia's government has described new laws passed in early February as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"".

,,,reliable,,"Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania. A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them. They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding. Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years. False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress. Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight. ""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'."" ""It's just absolutely horrific."" The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media. ""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said. ""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else."" Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful. ""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service. With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales. ""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said. That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday. Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"". Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access. More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast. Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022. Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication. There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore. Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.

There is a lingering question over how much lasting damage it will have on her reputation and career. After the case, the Australia and Chelsea player apologised ""for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening"". The trial heard Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis had been out drinking when they were driven to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi driver who complained that they had refused to pay clean-up costs after Kerr was sick, and Mewis had smashed the vehicle's rear window. Kerr said she and her partner had feared for their lives and in an expletive-laden exchange, accused one of the police officers of being ""stupid and white"". Kerr was supported by her parents and brother Levi throughout the case. Her fiancee Mewis was in the public gallery once she had finished giving evidence as a witness for the defence. When the verdict was read out, Kerr did not show much emotion while Mewis was in tears in the public gallery. But when court broke, Kerr gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to her barrister, Grace Forbes. When it came to character evidence, Kerr had the support of high-profile figures in the world of football as well as family and friends including former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes and captain Millie Bright, who provided written references. Ex-Chelsea and England goalkeeper Carly Telford was the only character witness to give evidence in court, and said that while her former team-mate was ""exuberant"" on the pitch, she was ""quite shy and humble"" off it. Kerr herself acknowledged that being reminded of her behaviour on the night in question was ""embarrassing"", and apologised in court and again in her post-trial statement for the way she had expressed herself.

,,,reliable,,"Hate symbols and terror offences will be punishable with mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years in Australia, after parliament passed a series of amendments to hate crime laws on Thursday. The new laws were passed following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks which have become a major topic of debate in the country. The amendments have been described by the government as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"". But critics say that the governing Labor Party is caving to opposition demands and going against its own policy of opposing mandatory jail sentences. Under the amendments, displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute is now punishable with at least one year in prison. Other penalties include a minimum of three years for financing terrorism and six years for committing or planning terrorist acts. There have been several attacks on Jewish targets in Australia in recent months. Last week authorities in Sydney found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. The discovery came just a week after a childcare centre near a Jewish school and synagogue in Sydney was set on fire and antisemitic graffiti was seen on one of its walls. In December, a synagogue in Melbourne was set alight with worshippers inside. No-one was seriously hurt in the incident, which sent shockwaves through the country. Former Labor senator Kim Carr criticised the party for what he said was a ""clear breach of the Labor party national platform"". Labor opposes mandatory sentences on the grounds that such penalties do not reduce crime, undermine the courts' independence and are often discriminatory in practice. But opposition parties did not rush to welcome the new amendments either, accusing Labor of dragging its feet. ""The parliament is not acting today because of the decisiveness of the Labor Party,"" Liberal senator James Paterson told reporters in Canberra. ""The prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally introduce tough legislation that will ensure there are real penalties for this behaviour."" Performing the Nazi salute and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika, have been banned since January 2024 and carry up to one year in jail.

,,,reliable,,"Australian scientists have produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction. Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and ""technical advancements"". The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeater's possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said. Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions. The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations. Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say. ""We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm,"" said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding ""the genetic material of these unique and precious animals"". IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over.

Police said the 82-year-old woman's body was found in a cane paddock in Queensland on Tuesday, two days after a 63-year-old woman died when a dinghy she was in overturned during a rescue attempt. The region has been inundated since Saturday, with parts of northern Queensland seeing nearly 2m (6.5 ft) of rain. By Tuesday, conditions were starting to ease - although Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned it was still ""a disaster that's going to test the resolve of people"" during an interview with broadcaster ABC. He described the devastation as ""incredible"", but noted weather conditions had been ""really kind"" in recent hours. Thousands had begun to return to their homes. In Townsville, locals woke on Tuesday to grey skies and drizzle, and the news that predicted flooding levels had not materialised there. It was a stark contrast to the intense downpours which have battered the region over the past few days. ""We believe that the danger has passed,"" Townsville Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson told reporters. Pointing to earlier forecasts which had suggested up to 2,000 Townsville homes could have faced flood risks, Crisafulli said that ""the city had dodged a bullet"". Local resident Jo Berry told the BBC she and her family were among those returning home on Tuesday, after spending a sleepless night monitoring the rainfall. ""People talk about PTSD when it rains here and I totally understand,"" says Ms Berry, formerly from Leicester in the UK. ""We've been in the house here for over 20 years, and have been through a few cyclone events and the 2019 flooding so it is not our first rodeo,"" she adds, referring to a flooding disaster which caused A$1.24bn (£620m; $770m) in damage. On Monday night, other local residents told the BBC they were ""on a knife edge"" as they waited to see whether their houses would survive. But further north in the state, power outages and damaged roads have made it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction in towns such as Ingham and Cardwell. Crisafulli said early reports suggested the damage was ""quite frankly incredible"" and that Ingham, which is almost entirely without electricity, ""remains the biggest challenge"". ""There are people who have been inundated at home, in their businesses and in their farms,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. Footage published in local media showed long lines at the town's supermarket as people waited for critical supplies. Crisafulli said that amid the blackout the local hospital was operating as normal, and a petrol station was open. The flooding has caused damage to the area's homes, crops and coastline, local MP Nick Dametto said in a video posted online. ""The inundation is something that I have never seen before,"" he said. Home to fewer than 5,000 people, Ingham was already reeling after the 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday. The second woman's body was found on Tuesday just north of Ingham after a neighbour raised the alarm. She was last seen on Monday night in a house, Queensland Police said in a statement. More than 8,000 properties remain without power across northern Queensland, according to the state's energy provider, and the partial collapse of a critical highway continues to hinder efforts to assist some of the hardest-hit areas. Crisafulli said the recovery effort would ""take some time"" and that the priority in the coming hours would be to work with the army to get power generators to isolated communities and ""bring them back online"". He added that federal funding would help reconstruct the battered Bruce Highway - the state's main thoroughfare which stretches 1,673km (1,039 miles) from the south. Located in the tropics, northern Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding. Speaking to the BBC in Townsville, Scott Heron, a local resident and climate expert, said the latest disaster was not unexpected. ""For a long time, climate scientists have been clear that extreme weather events will become more extreme, and we are seeing that,"" said Prof Heron , who works at James Cook University and is the Unesco Chair on Climate Vulnerability of Heritage. Prof Heron urged politicians to consider this as they planned recovery and rebuilding efforts, such as to the Bruce Highway. It would be ""wasting public money"" if infrastructure planning, particularly for long-term projects including roads and bridges, did not ""incorporate changing threats due to climate change"", he said.

Mr Duric lives across the street from the Ross River – overflowing and fast-moving – in Idalia, one of six suburbs labelled ""black zones"" in Townsville, one of the areas hardest hit by a flooding emergency in Queensland state in Australia. Authorities have urged people living in those spots to leave. They were given a deadline of noon on Sunday, but like plenty of others, Mr Duric has opted to stay put. ""We've only been here 12 months, so I've relied on a lot of information from people around us,"" he says.

,,,reliable,,"Fourteen members of an Australian religious group have been convicted of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl who was denied insulin for almost a week. Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes. The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,"" he said. ""However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families. The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. ""She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent,"" prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane. No effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard. The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine. They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life. Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to ""stop the insulin"" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" he told the court. Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had ""no intention of fighting"" the case by using law. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk. She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence. At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having ""let his daughter down"". The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so. Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth. But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death. Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the ""system had failed"" her sister. ""We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home,"" she said in a statement outside court. The group is expected to be sentenced next month. Toowoomba has long had a ""colourful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds"", says Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements. ""The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families,"" he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the close-knit congregation. Jayde Struhs said the Saints had attended the Revival Centres International church in Brisbane, but they broke away after Stevens failed to become a pastor there. They then formed their own parish and held sermons at his house multiple times a week, she said.",,,,Australian sect members guilty of causing girl's death,"Hannah Ritchie, BBC News, Sydney",,,,,,,1

It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised. Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain. The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as ""a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation"". Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose. The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later. There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January. In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words ""the colony will fall"". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it. Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip. Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people. To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement.

There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents. Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes. Albanese said it appeared some of the crimes were ""being perpetrated by people who don't have a particular issue, aren't motivated by an ideology, but are paid actors"". ""Now, it's unclear who or where the payments are coming from,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it was possible that cryptocurrencies - which can take longer to identify - had been used. He added that police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online. However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, ""intelligence is not the same as evidence"" and more charges were expected soon. Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation. Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was ""as cowardly as it is disgusting"" and described it as a ""hate crime"". ""This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together,"" he wrote on social media.

,,,reliable,,"A woman in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real. The unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a ""prank"" for his Instagram account. She only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia. A Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday. The bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time. In December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted. Two days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a ""white party"" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress. But when they arrived she was ""shocked"" and ""furious"" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents. ""So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page,"" she said. She said she had accepted his explanation as ""he was a social media person"" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court. Still, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend ""laughed it off"" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not. Reassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to ""play along"" to ""make it look real"". Two months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners. When she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony. The woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's. ""I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application,"" she said. In his deposition, the man claimed they had ""both agreed to these circumstances"" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an ""intimate ceremony"" in Sydney. The judge ruled that the woman was ""mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed"" and ""did not provide real consent to her participation"" in the marriage. ""She believed she was acting.

,,,reliable,,"For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches. Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia. ""It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,"" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC. For her – and most Australians – cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach. Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them. ""The sheer amount of space that people are taking up… [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,"" Claire says. She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette. A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister. Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers. ""When you're… polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,"" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project. ""I just want my space on the beach, guys."" But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself. Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters – including national charity, the Cancer Council – argue the new trend should actually be celebrated. ""My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,"" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant. No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents. Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine. Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing ""the prime piece of real estate"" on busy beaches. She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day. ""There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides.

,,,reliable,,"Sam Konstas first revealed his plan to ramp Jasprit Bumrah over a pre-match meal late on Christmas Day. ""We had dinner the night before the game and he said he would do it on 150 if he got there,"" his batting coach Tahmid Islam tells BBC Sport. Fast forward a few hours and debutant Konstas, Australia's new 19-year-old batting sensation, was doing so on Boxing Day in front of 90,000 people at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Only, he had not waited until his 150th run, and not even his 150th ball. ""Initially I thought I might be out of a job as batting coach when he missed the first couple,"" Islam says. Konstas may have failed with those first two scoops, but he tried again soon after and hit Bumrah - the world's top-ranked bowler - for a six and two fours on the way to 60 from 65 balls. Those shots marked one of the most remarkable starts to a Test career in recent memory – cult hero status gained in a matter of minutes by a batter long tipped for the top. Because, while Konstas' emergence at the highest level was explosive, the journey to get there has been long. He was the Sydney suburb kid of Greek heritage who was scoring hundreds before his age had reached double figures. In October he became the youngest player since the great Ricky Ponting to score centuries in each innings of a match in the Sheffield Shield, Australia's first-class competition. Two years before that, and just a month after his 17th birthday, Konstas became the youngest batter to score a century for Sutherland in the top tier of Sydney's notoriously tough grade cricket. The previous holder of that record? A certain Steve Smith. ""I remember not being too surprised it was him that did it,"" says Sutherland captain Tom Doyle. The talent has always been there, those scoop shots too. ""We had a T20 game and he had come off a hundred in the U21s game in the morning,"" says Doyle, remembering another innings by Konstas while still aged 17. ""I remember him getting sledged by the opposition and he preceded to ramp like he did for Australia against some pretty intimidating first grade bowlers."" A host of internationals have passed through the club's pavilion - Smith, Shane Watson, West Indies legend Andy Roberts and Glenn McGrath to name a few. Konstas joined as a 17-year-old in 2022 from St George's - the club where the great Sir Don Bradman once played - in a switch that made the newspapers, such was the noise around him. ""It is hard to compare,"" Doyle says. ""From a talent level, Sam is no doubt on par. ""He is on this upwards curve where he keeps getting better and better each time he plays."" Those that know Konstas describe him as polite and a hard worker. During his time at Cranbrook School, then in his early teens, he first met Islam - a former first-class cricketer and a batting consultant in the school's cricket set-up. He and Islam speak every day, practising together numerous times per week, while Watson, the all-rounder who played 307 times for Australia, has become a mentor working on Konstas' mental approach. ""The one that really sticks out was when I was at the rugby grand final and Sammy kept calling me,"" Islam says. ""He wasn't quite happy with how he had batted in his club session, had a game the next day and wanted a net session at 6am before his game. ""I remember thinking I have never seen anyone have that desire and hunger to make sure he has ticked every box to give himself the best chance. ""He hit for about an hour and a half and got 205 in that game."" While Konstas' first innings in international cricket had all of the shots of a Bazballer, scoring big hundreds is how he made his name. ""Looking back on a lot of Sam's innings, he doesn't play every day of cricket the same,"" says Sutherland's Doyle. ""He is a multi-dimensional cricketer. The way he played in a lot of his first grade innings is more traditional, with a spark of flair here and there."" The other thing people mention when talking about Konstas is confidence. The confidence to ramp Bumrah, the confidence to not be put off by a shoulder barge by Virat Kohli, the confidence to point to the name on the back of his shirt when reaching 50 and wave his arm to ramp up the capacity Boxing Day crowd. England might well be taking notes, with the Ashes coming up towards the end of 2025 down under. ""There can be a blurred line between arrogance and confidence,"" Doyle says. ""Sam has, through a lot of hard work and persistence, developed a level of confidence to score runs in a way that works for him. ""You see him revving up the crowds. We don't have crowds at grade cricket but that is his personality coming out. He is an energised, enthusiastic and eager cricketer. ""Him being that person for the crowd is just his personality coming out."" That confidence will, of course, be tested as his international career continues. The second-innings effort was more difficult for Konstas, as he reached only eight before Bumrah gained some revenge with an inswinger that hit middle stump having gone through the gate. ""He has always had this desire and hunger to get it right and to continue to develop his game,"" Islam says of Konstas. ""At the start of every season we write down a few goals and plans for the season coming up and playing Test cricket certainly wasn't part of that."" Those goals may have changed after Konstas' week in the spotlight. He will hope the run-scoring does not.",,,,The making of Konstas - Australia's new batting star,No author available,,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala's watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body. Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped. Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary's hospital. Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland's Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this. Outside the clinic, in a ""Koala Rehab Centre"" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. ""It saved her life… but she can't reproduce,"" the head vet Michael Pyne says. Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible. This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction. But it's also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money. Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country's populous east coast. But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years. Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse. ""[But] it's the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially,"" says Dr Pyne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years. ""You get days where you're euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged."" Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. Dr Pyne wistfully recounts ""the early days"" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year. They now see 400. So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains. Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest. It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time. At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so ""nasty"" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain. ""Their reproductive system falls apart,"" Dr Pyne explains. If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal ""nightmare"" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source. On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin. Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched. Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%. It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been ""falling off a cliff"", Dr Pyne says. ""It's a disaster.""

Communities around the Grampians, in Victoria, have been evacuated amid warnings from authorities that conditions there in the days ahead could be the worst since Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called ""Black Summer"" of 2019-20. The bushfires have already burnt over 41,000 hectares (101,000 acres) of land in the past week, however there have been no deaths or loss of property. Intense heat forecast for Boxing Day has also prompted a string of fire warnings across the country.

Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf. ""They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families. The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies. The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police. The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia. Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison. The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world. One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year. Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.

,,,reliable,,"A pilot who caused a deadly light plane crash on an island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared a jail sentence. British tourist Jocelyn Spurway, 29, was killed and 21-year-old Irish woman Hannah O'Dowd seriously injured when the aircraft hit the sand on Middle Island in January 2017. A jury found pilot Leslie Woodall guilty of dangerously operating a vehicle causing death and grievous bodily harm, after a short trial which focused on his actions after the plane's engine suddenly failed. Woodall was given a two-year sentence, wholly suspended - which means he will remain free as long as he complies with certain conditions. The three-day trial in the Brisbane District Court was shown footage filmed by one of the three passengers inside the plane, which captured the moment the engine stopped and Woodall sharply turned the plane to the left. The Cessna 172N then rapidly lost altitude, before a wing hit the sand and it rolled. Ms Spurway suffered fatal spinal injuries, and her friend Ms O'Dowd was left with a traumatic brain injury and a series of fractures. Woodall also sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old boy who was on board suffered a broken ankle. Prosecutors argued it was not the engine failure that caused the crash, but rather Woodall's response to it. Aviation experts who gave evidence during the trial agreed that Woodall, an experienced pilot, went against flight training and best practice. He should have kept the wings level in order to glide and safely land, they said. However Woodall's defence team argued he had little other options available to him in a highly stressful situation. In a 2019 police interview played to the court he told officers he was trying to reach a sandbank, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, is accused by police of driving past a speed camera at 158km/h (98mph) on a Perth highway last month. It is alleged to have occurred whilst Barrientos was on bail over an alleged attack on a woman in a Perth hotel in September. The BBC has contacted Barrientos's representatives for comment. When approached for comment, police said they were unable to confirm the charges by name but said a 29-year-old man had been charged with reckless driving. Police say the speeding incident happened on 17 November, in the High Wycombe area of Perth, where the speed limit is 100km/h, and his car was impounded. Barrientos will appear in court accused of reckless driving on 19 December, where he will also appear over four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of impeding a person's normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on or to their neck. It is alleged Barrientos brought a woman in her 20s back to his hotel room after he had performed at the nightclub Bar1 in Perth. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music. Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad and has presented shows on BBC Three. He has also appeared, in the UK, on ITV's Soccer Aid and Channel 4's Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.

,,,reliable,,"The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins. The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ""community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders"" and will act as a deterrent. But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it. The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law. The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ""rights of victims"" ahead of ""the rights of criminals"". ""These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state,"" Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday. Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue. But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since. Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend. Dubbed by the government as ""adult crime, adult time"", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years. Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was ""particularly heinous"". The laws also remove ""detention as a last resort"" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing. The Queensland Police Union has called the changes ""a leap forward in the right direction"", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to ""better address patterns of offending"" and ""hold people accountable for their actions"". But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full. Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory. Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be ""pressure in the short-term"" his government had a long-term plan to ""deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options"". Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an ""international embarrassment"". She also accused Queensland's government of ""ignoring evidence"" which suggests ""the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes"". ""The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday. Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.

,,,reliable,,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) will join Australia's national rugby league competition, after signing a deal that obligates them to shun security ties with China. The Pacific nation has produced many stars of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and has long been lobbying to join the franchise. Australia will provide A$600m (£301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team – which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 – and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region. In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner. The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called ""Pacific family"". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region. If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team. Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a ""monumental"" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering ""unity"" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour. ""For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,"" he told reporters. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a ""great day"" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - ""deserves"" a spot in the league. ""The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea… And I know it will have millions of proud fans barracking for it from day one,"" Albanese said. It is a big milestone for the NRL too. This is the first time the competition, which is trying to lure international audiences, has expanded overseas. The only other foreign team, the New Zealand Warriors, has been a part of the competition since its inception almost three decades ago. NRL boss Peter V'landys had been championing the PNG bid, arguing it was a huge opportunity for the league, as well as for PNG's economic development. A name and uniform for the new team will be decided at a later point. Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented. The country has over the past decade been ""thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats"" said Dr Murray, from Bond University. In this case, he added, ""the scale, the size, the scope and the funding, and the fact that it's being endorsed at such a high level with both prime ministers - that's never been done before"". ""Basically, through this one channel, we will open up 20 or 30 other channels - for business, trade, policing, educational exchange, gender work, climate change... I think it is fantastic."" Australia and China have each been vying for greater influence in the Pacific in recent years. After Beijing inked a major policing deal with the Solomon Islands in 2022, Australia has spent years trying to forge exclusive security pacts with countries across the region – including a policing agreement with Tuvalu last year, and a treaty with Nauru unveiled earlier this week. Some have lauded the pact with PNG - which declared independence from Australia in 1975 - as another major strategic win for Australia. ""Over the past couple of years, with the heightened geopolitical interest and engagement in the Pacific, something a lot of other middle powers and major powers have struggled to do is to get PNG on a deal of exclusivity for security partnerships,"" said Oliver Nobetau, a PNG government lawyer turned policy analyst at the Lowy Institute think tank. Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a ""thinning"" relationship between the two countries. Marape made a point to say the agreement ""doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours"". ""We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,"" he said. ""But in security, closer to home… our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed… together."" Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as ""an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty"". Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging ""transactional"" dynamic in Pacific relations. ""People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,"" Dr Murray said. ""For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy."" Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region. ""China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure… which is sort of what China is good at… [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,"" Mr Nobetau said. ""It's something that other countries can't do,"" Dr Murray added.

,,,reliable,,"Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news. The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms. Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers. The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; £125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes. The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok. In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was ""charging one industry to subsidise another"". Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers. ""Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,"" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday. The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content. That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms. As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers. Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere. ""We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content… news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,"" it said in a statement in February. The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as ""a fundamental dereliction"" of Meta's ""responsibility to its Australian users"". ""The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,"" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time. The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February.

,,,reliable,,"Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has pleaded guilty over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins. Hoskins died in hospital on 30 December 2023, after being struck by a vehicle being driven by Dennis outside their home in Adelaide. The 34-year-old was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care, but on Tuesday he admitted a lesser charge - one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm. Dennis - who has two children with Hoskins - will be sentenced at a later date. Few details are known about the circumstances leading up to Hoskins's death. However, Dennis's guilty plea means he has admitted to driving a car when Hoskins was in close proximity, knowing that act was likely to cause harm or being recklessly indifferent to whether it would. ""There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death,"" the retired athlete's lawyer told the court. Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and a two-time Olympian, and her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world. She and Dennis married in 2018.

,,,reliable,,"A fire which ripped through Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue is being treated as a likely terror attack, Australian police say. Three suspects are being hunted over Friday's early-morning blaze, which left one man with a minor burn to his hand and caused extensive damage. Witnesses say they saw masked figures spreading what appeared to be an accelerant in the building, before setting it alight. Victoria Police say they have no evidence that further antisemitic attacks are planned, but patrols are being increased to reassure the community. After a meeting with Australian Federal Police and domestic spy agency Asio, the state police force said additional ""intelligence"" had led them to conclude the incident should be treated as a probable terror attack. Commissioner Shane Patton said police had no information before the fire to suggest an arson attack was imminent. He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued. Mr Patton's declaration came a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as ""quite clearly terrorism"" while acknowledging police were still to make up their minds. He called his description a ""personal view"". On Monday, state Premier Jacinta Allan said the terror designation meant police would now have extra resources for their investigation. Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia, and that it has heightened fears of violence. A few worshippers were inside the building at the time of the fire, and have described hearing banging and seeing a window smash, before liquids were thrown inside and lit on fire. ""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper. After officers at the scene were confronted by angry and scared worshippers on Friday, Mr Patton said police were focused on ensuring their safety. ""We have... extra police officers deployed in those areas where there are high numbers of Jewish persons living and congregating,"" he said. Allan also called for the city to rally behind its Jewish communities. ""We cannot let this conflict overseas continue to be a cloak for behaviour like [this]."" Albanese also on Monday announced a new federal strikeforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism. The prime minister said a special response was needed to combat the rising threat, pointing to two other recent incidents - the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office and an attack in Sydney in which a car was torched and buildings graffitied.",,,,"Melbourne synagogue fire 'likely' terror act, police say","Tiffanie Turnbull, BBC News, Sydney",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, has arrived in Melbourne after being extradited from Italy. Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since. Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs. Mr Kouroumblis - who has not been charged and maintains his innocence - was detained in Italy in September. If charged, he is expected to face court later this week, according to local media. Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb. The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive. Ms Armstrong's one-year-old son was also found in the home, unharmed in his cot. Both women had been stabbed more than a dozen times and Ms Armstrong had been sexually assaulted, police say. The case has long drawn huge interest - becoming the subject of major police appeals, true crime books and a hit podcast. In 2017 Victoria Police offered a A$1m (£511,800, $647,600) reward for information. Commissioner Shane Patton described the murders as ""an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide"" when announcing the arrest of Mr Kouroumblis - a dual Greek-Australian citizen - in Rome in September. ""This was a crime that struck at the heart of our community - two women in their own home, where they should have felt their safest,"" he said. Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago. But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime. At the time of Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed ""irrevocably"" by the murders.

,,,reliable,,"Australian Police have seized 2.3 tonnes of cocaine from a broken-down boat off the coast of Queensland, authorities said on Monday. Eleven men and two juveniles were arrested, including the vessel's crew and others waiting on the shore to collect the illegal shipment. The drugs had an estimated street value of A$760m ($490m; £388m), with the potential to be distributed across 11.7 million separate street deals - making it the largest cocaine bust in Australian history. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) alleged one of the men arrested on Saturday night was vice-president of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle club’s Brisbane chapter. Biker gangs are notorious in Australia for their drug violence, with more than 1,000 shootings recorded since the 1980s. This recent cocaine bust came as part of a wider investigation into the Comanchero gang, codenamed Operation Tyrrendor, which began last month. Authorities said they received intelligence suggesting a criminal syndicate with links to the gang was planning to import illegal drugs into Australia. This comes after reports last week that the Colombian navy intercepted a semi-submersible carrying cocaine to Australia. Investigators told reporters in Brisbane the record cocaine shipment had come from an unidentified South American country. The AFP worked with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and the Australian Border Force (ABF) to track a fishing boat, recently purchased by a 35-year-old man. On Saturday night, it was being used to transport the cocaine delivery from a larger mothership to the Queensland coast when it suffered a mechanical fault, police said. Stranded about 18km from the north-eastern tip of K'gari, it was intercepted by the AFP and QPS, who found 51 bales of cocaine tied with rope netting. Two men were arrested on the boat and two others were arrested on the coast while waiting for the shipment. A further three arrests were made at a nearby fast-food restaurant, with five others at a traffic stop. The final arrest was made in Brisbane after the AFP and QPS executed a search warrant. All 11 men and two juveniles were were charged with conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.",,,,Australian police seize $500m of cocaine after boat breaks down,"Alex Loftus, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws. The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they don't comply. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the ""harms"" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed. But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered. This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday. “We want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs,"" Albanese told reporters afterwards. The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia’s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules. However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared. The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves. However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected. They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user’s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country. Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however. Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers. ""For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out,"" Amy Friedlander, who was among those lobbying for the ban, recently told the BBC. ""We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of."" But many experts say the ban is ""too blunt an instrument"" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet. During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be ""ineffective"" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer. In its submission, TikTok said the government’s definition of a social media platform was so ""broad and unclear"" that ""almost every online service could fall within [it]"". X questioned the ""lawfulness"" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed. Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate. ""We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media… but we need to be involved in developing solutions,"" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator. Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill. ""We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access – but we know that it’s the right thing to do,"" he said on Friday. Last year, France introduced legislation to block social media access for children under 15 without parental consent, though research indicates almost half of users were able to avoid the ban using a VPN. A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - was overturned by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional. Australia’s laws are being watched with great interest by global leaders. Norway has recently pledged to follow in the country’s footsteps, and last week the UK’s technology secretary said a similar ban was “on the table” - though he later added “not... at the moment”.

In the last four editions of the Sheffield Shield he’s the fourth leading run scorer, and is the only batter to average in excess of 50 having played at least 10 matches. While spinners do tend to find life difficult in Australia, Webster’s recent record against them - an average of 172 in the last four years - is exceptional. He’s a tall man and loves to pull (average 94) and cut (average 200) the quicks. Webster could also relieve the pressure that’s been placed on Australia’s fifth bowler Mitchell Marsh, who continues to struggle with his fitness. He often comes on first change for Tasmania, and in the 2023-24 Sheffield Shield season took 30 wickets at an average of 29, with an unusual mix of seam up and spin deliveries. County fans may also be familiar with Webster from a brief stint with Gloucestershire last season, where he averaged 58 with the bat from four County Championship matches, and took a tidy 16 wickets at 21.

For help and support dealing with grief, please visit the BBC Action Line At some point in the previous year, for a lot of people who follow cricket, the thought would have come up. Late November in the last nine years has included moments of remembrance for Phillip Hughes, Australia's prodigy who died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014, trying to make a score to get back into the Test team. This year marks a decade since that loss. In grief, milestones are everywhere. The ones that surprise us are marked in space, things we stumble into like low furniture. Here's a garden near my old house, and here's me remembering the last time you walked through it. The predictable ones are marked in time. Months at first, then anniversaries, birthdays twinned in the mental calendar with dates of death. Some dates evaporate. Some lodge. So in a world that puts store in anniversaries, this one is significant. And complicated. Hughes' injury happened on 25 November, two days before an official announcement of death. That means there is not exactly an anniversary, but more a long weekend of mourning. For those three days in the cricket world you are acutely aware of the sensitivity. This coming week or two his story will feature heavily. The Perth Test, which finished on Monday, was never planned to be part of this, given the lack of certainty around an end date. The ceremony instead will happen around the Adelaide Test from 6 December.

,,,reliable,,"A tourist in Tasmania has had his leg amputated in the middle of a raging river after getting trapped between rocks during a kayaking trip with friends. Medics said they made the ""life or death"" decision in consultation with the international visitor during a complex rescue on the Franklin River lasting some 20 hours. The visitor in his 60s was partially submerged in water throughout the ordeal, and rescuers said it was clear that ""had he remained in the location where he was, and trapped in the rock crevice he would not have survived"". Multiple attempts to move him prior to the amputation were unsuccessful, police in the Australian island state said. The tourist was kayaking with a group in the south-west of Tasmania when his leg got stuck between rocks in an area of rapids on Friday afternoon. Emergency services rushed to the remote and inaccessible area after the man's smartwatch called for assistance, police said. After a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to free the man overnight and as his condition deteriorated, the decision was made to amputate his leg so he could be winched from the location and airlifted to hospital. ""This rescue was an extremely challenging and technical operation, and an incredible effort over many hours to save the man’s life,” Doug Oosterloo, acting assistant commissioner at Tasmania Police, said in a statement. ""This was a life and death situation,"" Oosterloo told Australian national broadcaster ABC. The man is now in a critical condition in hospital. Oosterloo said that though the kayaker was “well prepared”, he wasn’t prepared for spending ""that significant amount of time in a rock crevice with that temperature and the torrent of water that was he was under”. The other 10 travellers who were kayaking with the man were being airlifted from the area and police plan to speak to them about how the accident happened, the Australian Associated Press reported. Oosterloo told the news agency that the tourists had stopped kayaking and were on the shore when the man slipped. “He was scouting the area and he slipped and fell into that rock crevice,” Oosterloo said.",,,,Kayaker's leg amputated in middle of river after 20-hour rescue,"Grace Dean, BBC News",,,,,,,1

The judges said Perry had been using her name as a trademark five years before Taylor started her business, adding that by that time, Perry had attained an ""international reputation"" in entertainment.

,,,reliable,,"“I felt really scared to be honest,” says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school. The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers. Almost instantly, his phone “started blowing up” with a string of violent messages. “One of them sounded like he was probably 17,” James tells the BBC. “He sent me videos of him with a machete… he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.” James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account. His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government’s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym. The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as “world-leading”. But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be. Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the “harms” of social media. ""This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,"" he said on Thursday. The new legislation provides a ""framework"" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail. Instead, it will be up to the nation’s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed. According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create “low-risk services"" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set. Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn’t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape. A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as “a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges”. Such legislation could push kids into “dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet”, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given “technology change is always going to outpace policy”. “It will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government’s policy, which is that there’s a causal link between social media and declining mental health. “I would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,” she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, “feel more themselves online than they do in the real world”. This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. “This [ban] destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,” the Perth teenager tells the BBC. Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water. “We don’t fence the ocean… but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,” she told parliament earlier this year. But Emma - who has lobbied for the ban through the parent-led Heads Up Alliance - sees it differently. “Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?"" she says. “Or should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?” Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees. “We can’t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven’t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren’t ready for it.” Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as ""too blunt an instrument"" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have “safe access” to digital environments. It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that’s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations. To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce ""digital duty of care"" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety. Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban “could be part of a strategy, it absolutely can’t be the whole strategy”. She says “the biggest piece of the puzzle” should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media. The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free “digital literacy tools” to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren’t receiving regular lessons. Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the “enormous risks” associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online. The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested. In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user’s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to “preserve” their privacy. However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. “I can’t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,” she tells the BBC. Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online.",,,,Australia wants to ban kids from social media.

,,,reliable,,"Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says. The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation. The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week. However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough. Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy. Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought ""no sense of relief"" for him. ""I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,"" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities. The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks. Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector. The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it. Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill ""a dog's breakfast"" and vowed to introduce ""deeper cuts"" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May. The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill ""dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause"". The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked ""tough"" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years. The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place. The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed. But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure. ""The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,"" Mr Sheehy said. ""We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps.""",,,,Uncertainty after Australia foreign students bill hits opposition,"Tiffanie Turnbull, BBC News, Sydney",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Australian lawmakers have voted to censure an Aboriginal senator who heckled King Charles during his visit to Canberra last month, to express their ""profound disapproval"" of her protest. Lidia Thorpe shouted ""you are not my King"" and ""this is not your land"" shortly after the King addressed the Great Hall of Parliament, in an effort to highlight the impacts of British colonisation. The Senate's censure, which passed 46-12, described Thorpe's actions as ""disrespectful and disruptive"" and said they should disqualify her from representing the chamber as a member of any delegation. A censure motion is politically symbolic but carries no constitutional or legal weight. Shortly after the Senate vote on Monday, Thorpe told reporters she had been denied her right to respond in the chamber due to a flight delay. ""The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the first peoples of this country... I will not be silent,"" the independent senator said. Her protest last month drew immediate ire from across the political aisle, as well as from some prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. But it also drew praise from some activists who argued that it highlighted the plight of Australia's first inhabitants, who endured colonial violence and still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Thorpe is among those who have advocated for a treaty between Australia’s government and its first inhabitants. Unlike New Zealand and other former British colonies, a treaty with Indigenous peoples in Australia was never established. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people emphasise that they never ceded their sovereignty or land to the Crown. Despite the protest, the King was warmly greeted by Australian crowds during his five-day tour alongside Queen Camilla. “You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in an official address. Thorpe has a history of Indigenous activism which has, at times, grabbed global headlines. During her swearing in ceremony in 2022, the Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman referred to the Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser - and was asked to retake her oath after facing criticism. Last year, Australia decisively rejected a proposal to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people constitutional recognition and allow them to establish a body to advise parliament on issues impacting their communities. The referendum - known as the Voice - became ensnared in a bruising campaign, and both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly, leaving uncertainty over future policy.

The 83-year-old was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment early on Monday morning, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Mr Jones is one of Australia’s most influential media figures, and has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. He now faces 24 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters. ""I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. [They] have now got the ability to have a voice. This is what they've been asking for,"" he said. Commissioner Karen Webb earlier said police had conducted a ""very complex"", ""protracted"" and ""thorough"" investigation, and expected other alleged victims may now come forward. ""There's no such thing as a matter that's too old to be investigated,"" she said at a press conference. ""You will be listened to, and we will take your matter seriously."" Mr Jones has been granted conditional bail, and will face court on 18 December.

He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern.

,,,reliable,,"It took just three minutes for Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more during a rampage at a popular Sydney shopping centre, an inquest into the attack has been told. The New South Wales Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi, 40, was knife-obsessed and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but had come off his medication and was homeless at the time of the incident. The inquiry also heard that no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead by police. The incident on 13 April devastated Australia, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a national conversation about gendered violence. All up, 14 of the 16 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was ""obvious"" Cauchi had targeted women. Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state. Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come ""to the attention"" of Queensland police several times, she added. In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day. She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery. His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. Good - who has been described by her family as an ""all-round outstanding human"" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard. Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died ""trying to save others"". Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard. In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time. ""It’s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,"" Dwyer said. Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O’Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence. ""I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can’t be here in person,"" she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia.

The 400-page fantasy novel, Billy and the Epic Escape, features an Aboriginal girl with mystical powers living in foster care who is abducted from her home in central Australia. First Nations leaders have said the book reproduces ""harmful stereotypes"" and trivialises the ""complex and painful"" history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being forcibly removed from their families under government assimilation policies. Oliver - who is in Australia promoting a new cookbook - has apologised and said he was ""devastated"" to have caused hurt. ""It was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,"" he said in a statement. Publisher Penguin Random House UK said that a consultation with Indigenous Australians requested by Oliver had not happened due to an ""editorial oversight"". Critics said the book contained language errors and oversimplified the identity of First Nations character Ruby. ""This superficial treatment of Ruby's character dehumanises her, and by extension, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,"" said Sharon Davis of the First Nations educational body Natsiec. Among the complaints is that Ruby is given the ability to read people’s minds and communicate with animals and plants, because ""that’s the Indigenous way"". Sharon Davis said that reduced ""complex and diverse belief systems"" to ""magic"". The character is also at the centre of an abduction plot, something community leader Sue-Anne Hunter called a ""particularly insensitive choice,"" given the ""painful historical context"" of Australia's Stolen Generations. During the 20th Century, tens of thousands of Indigenous children were removed from their families under official government policies aimed at assimilation which assumed black inferiority and white superiority. This government policy continued officially until the 1970s. ""The story’s flippant approach to narrating the theft of a First Nations child dangerously trivialises the ongoing trauma associated with Australia’s violent history of child removal,"" Natsiec said. They added that today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 10 times more likely non-Indigenous children to be removed from their families into foster care or other systems. Critics have also pointed out language errors in the book. The character is from Mparntwe or Alice Springs in the Northern Territory but uses vocabulary from the language of the Gamilaraay people of the states of New South Wales and Queensland.

He survived the battle but died at the age of 24 in a traffic accident while on duty as a police officer in Canberra More than 60,000 Australians - about a quarter of them conscripted - served in controversial Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973, as part of an allied force led by the US. ""Private Richard Norden is a true Australian hero... [He] demonstrated extraordinary courage and selflessness by putting his own life at risk to save and protect his fellow comrades,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said after the announcement, on Remembrance Day. Pte Norden's company was ambushed by North Vietnamese Army soldiers on 14 May, 1968, with a scout immediately killed and the section Commander gravely injured. Described as having a ""complete disregard for his own personal safety"", he ran forward under heavy enemy fire to reach the two soldiers and carried the severely wounded section Commander back to his group. Himself seriously wounded by that point, Pte Norden then went back for the scout. Finding him dead, he then returned to the group to collect grenades before pushing into the battlefield for a third time, to clear the area so the scout's body could be recovered.

Initially believed to be tar balls, they were in fact a ""disgusting"" combination of human faeces, cooking oil, chemicals and illicit drugs, researchers say. Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of the black deposits started appearing from 16 October. Testing by chemists has determined the balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill, though their exact origin remains unknown. Last month authorities in New South Wales (NSW) said they suspected the objects were a mixture of fatty acids, fuel oil and chemicals found in cleaning and cosmetic products. But further testing found the material is unlikely to have originated solely from an oil spill or waste from a ship, as some had thought. Each ball was slightly different but had a firm surface - hardened partially by accumulating sand and minerals like calcium - and a soft core.

,,,reliable,,"Australia's government says it will introduce ""world-leading"" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the ""harm"" social media was inflicting on Australian children. ""This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,"" he said. While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media. There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws. The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place. While a lot of experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are sceptical over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together. Some researchers argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces. Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements. One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as ""too blunt an instrument"". In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing ""safety standards"" on social media platforms. The group also pointed to UN advice that ""national policies"" designed to regulate online spaces ""should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it"". But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content, misinformation, bullying and other social pressures. A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are ""not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely"" until at least 16, and that currently ""excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness"". When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it ""assumes an equal power relationship"". ""I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.""",,,,Australia plans social media ban for under-16s,"Hannah Ritchie, BBC News, Sydney",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Australian breaker Rachael Gunn has announced she will retire from competition, citing the viral response to her performance at the Paris Olympics. Gunn - who is known as B-girl Raygun - failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves, such as the sprinkler and a kangaroo hop. The 37-year-old university lecturer's moves catapulted her to global attention and ridicule, spawned conspiracy theories about her qualification, and reignited criticism of breaking's inclusion in the Olympics. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the saga had been so ""upsetting"" that she changed her mind. ""I just didn’t have any control over how people saw me or who I was,"" she told local radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. ""I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now. “I think the level of scrutiny that’s going to be there, and people will be filming it, and it will go online."" Gunn received a torrent of violent messages after the Olympics, and was the subject of an anonymous petition demanding she apologise. It falsely accused her and her husband of manipulating her selection at the expense of other Australian talent. She was vigorously defended by Olympic officials, but her performance split opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the sport. It also revived questions over whether breaking - which debuted in Paris but is not on the programme for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles - should have ever been included in the Olympics, due to the creative nature of the genre, which doesn't necessarily suit organised competition. Gunn has previously said the backlash took the joy out of the sport for her, which she again alluded to on Wednesday. ""Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good.

All Eurostar international services to and from the station were halted. Eurostar said its services would be back to normal on Saturday, and two extra return train journeys to London and Brussels had been added. Local rail traffic resumed on Friday evening at Gare du Nord, but the French operators SNCF and RATP said the schedule remained disrupted. French police evacuated 200 people from homes in Saint-Denis and temporarily closed part of the suburb's main ring road. The 500kg bomb was found two metres deep at a building site north of Gare du Nord, where rail workers were putting up a new bridge over the railway lines. Eurostar's Chief Safety and Stations Officer Simon Lejeune said the situation was ""complex"" and it was the ""better option"" to cancel all 32 services between London and Paris because it would give passengers ""clarity"" amid the ""uncertainty"". He said he was ""incredibly sorry"" for the travel disruption and the issues customers had faced accessing the Eurostar app. He told travellers they should be able to access the website to change their booking, get a refund or get a voucher. The bomb was discovered 200m away from the busy Paris périphérique, about 2.5km (1.5 miles) north of Gare du Nord, Europe's busiest train station. A nearby short northern stretch of the ring road and the A1 motorway were shut around Porte de la Chapelle. Traffic jams were recorded on 218km of roads in the Paris region. Authorities in Saint-Denis said there were six schools and a care facility for elderly people inside the evacuation zone, but they were not at risk, because they did not have windows overlooking the area. Homes with windows in a 500m (1,600ft) radius of the bomb were evacuated. Eurostar services were running normally between Brussels and Marne-la-Vallée to the east of Paris as well as trains between London and Brussels and London and Amsterdam.

Trump said he was contemplating the move because ""Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now"". Trump's comments marked a sharp change in tone. Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine's leader for not wanting peace with Russia. Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was ""finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine"", and repeated that he trusted Putin. Last Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country.

,,,reliable,,"Work is under way to make all men in Poland undergo military training, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. In a speech to the Polish parliament, Tusk said the government aimed to give full details in the coming months. Efforts are being made to ""prepare large-scale military training for every adult male in Poland,"" he told the Sejm. ""We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats."" Tusk said the Ukrainian army has 800,000 soldiers, whilst Russia has around 1.3 million and he wants to increase the size of the Polish army, including reservists, to 500,000 from around 200,000 now. ""We're talking about the need to have an army of half a million in Poland, including the reservists,"" he said. ""It seems if we organise things wisely, and I'm talking constantly with the Minister of Defence, we will have to use several courses of action. That means the reservists, but also intensive training to make those who do not go into the army fully-fledged and competent soldiers during a conflict,"" he added. Tusk said women may also undergo military training, but ""war, is still to a greater extent the domain of men"". The prime minister said his government was also ""carefully examining"" France's proposal to include Europe under its nuclear umbrella. ""I would like to know first of all in detail what it means in terms of the authority over these weapons,"" he said. Tusk pointed out Ukraine was invaded after it got rid of its own nuclear arsenal, adding Warsaw would like to acquire its own nuclear weapons, however remote a possibility that may be. ""Today, it is clear that we would be safer if we had our own nuclear arsenal, that is beyond doubt. In any case the road to that would be very long and there would have to be a consensus too,"" he said. Poland is already planning to spend 4.7% of its economic output on defence this year, the highest proportion in the Nato alliance. Tusk told parliament that spending should increase to 5% of GDP. Earlier, President Duda proposed amending the constitution to make defence spending at a level of 4% of GDP compulsory The prime minister also said he supports Poland withdrawing from the Ottawa convention that bans the use of antipersonnel landmines, and also possibly from the Dublin convention that bans the use of cluster munitions. Poland has ramped up defence spending since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022. It has signed arms contracts worth around $20bn (£15.5bn) with the United States to buy 250 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks, 32 F-35 jets, 96 Apache helicopters, Javelin missiles, and artillery rocket systems. Warsaw has also signed contracts with South Korea to purchase K2 tanks and FA-50 light combat aircraft. There is growing anxiety among Poles about their future security following US President Donald Trump's decision to suspend military supplies to Ukraine. Most Poles believe supporting Ukraine is in their own security interests. Mirosław Kaznowski, the deputy mayor of Milanówek, a small town outside Warsaw, told BBC News this week that a friend of his has decided to invest in a start-up to build low-cost underground bomb shelters for businesses and homes.

,,,reliable,,"Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder. The Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin. But as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him. He thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording. That morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance. As the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian – Katrin Ivanova – sent a message on Telegram. Then two more. Her partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin. Another woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route. Waiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes. They'd lost him. Operational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty. ""We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,"" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC. ""It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers."" Watching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47. An associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent. He moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence – the interception of communications or electronic signals. When police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, ""a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance"". They might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth £175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop. Among the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek. Roussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company. Then, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times, the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of £20 billion at its peak, was intact. Now, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse. Together, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia. Linked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK. The group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination. Alongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed ""The Destroyer"" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov. A neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's ""enormous calves"". But they were not ineffective – Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police. The group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his ""friends in Russia"". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his ""minions"", Dzhambazov chief among them. ""There are no bosses here,"" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev. Nonetheless, ""minion"" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone. The group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022. But it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023. Between August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app. They reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years – four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime. As well as Dobrokhotov, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door. He was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins. A thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state. Gaberova was instructed to befriend him. In Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as ""Red Sparrow"". Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat – a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow. A former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home. Ivan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate. When confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen. Prosecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev ""is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations"".",,,,How spy ring did Russia's dirty work from the UK,"Chris Bell, BBC News Investigations, Tom Beal, BBC News Investigations, Daniel De Simone, BBC News Investigations Correspondent",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"A County Mayo man who was paralysed in a car crash has been given a chance to live a ""relatively normal life"" thanks to what surgeons are calling ground-breaking surgery. Yousaf Ghaffar was told he would never walk again following the collision in 2022. At just 18, the student was paralysed from the waist down - until surgery last year. Mr Ghaffar is now able to stand and walk several hundred steps with the aid of a robotic suit after doctors implanted a spinal cord stimulator. Mr Ghaffar was injured outside Letterkenny, County Donegal, where he is a student. He had joined his friend for a drive near the town when the car he was travelling in was involved in a crash. He does not remember much about what happened. ""When I woke up, I tried to get out of the car, but I couldn't move my legs,"" he said. ""One second I had just finished college, and the next I'm being rushed to the hospital in Dublin."" When Mr Ghaffar asked a doctor if he would ever be able to walk again, he got a ""disappointing look"" in return. ""That's where I got my answer,"" he said. ""You always see people in wheelchairs. You never truly think of what would happen if you can't walk. ""I never thought of that before until this accident actually happened. ""You go from being a fully independent college student, to being completely dependent. It didn't feel real."" Unbeknown to Mr Ghaffar, consultant pain specialist Prof Kirk Levins was in the process of developing a surgical procedure that would change his life. ""The story started four years ago when I met a like-minded researcher at a conference in Barcelona,"" said Prof Levins. He spent the next few years researching and developing the procedure. ""The way the surgery works is [a spinal cord stimulator] supplies that little bit of an extra boost to the spinal cord to make dormant pathways come alive again."" He added that the surgery had been ""experimental"". ""This was the first time this surgery has ever been done in this manner,"" he said. During Mr Ghaffar's surgery rigid wire leads were inserted through an epidural needle to stimulate the spinal cord at a specific frequency and location. The results were instant, said the surgeon. ""The biggest moment of my career was after the surgery when Yousaf was in the recovery bay,"" he said. ""We were trying to fine tune the device, and all of a sudden Yousaf started to move. ""That was the big 'wow' moment of this whole journey."" Since the operation, Mr Ghaffar has been relearning how to walk with the aid of an exoskeleton, but hopes one day he will be able to walk independently. Staff at St Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin, where the procedure took place, believe it may be the first of its kind. ""No-one has ever reported a return of sensation and such a rapid return of movement as Yousaf has experienced,"" said Prof Levins. ""It has taken a long time to get here. Four years, meetings at three o'clock in the morning, it has been a busy time. ""The results are absolutely phenomenal."" Prof Levins said he hoped the procedure would mean that, for some people, paralysis would be a ""temporary condition"". ""The only barriers at this stage are further research, financial considerations and training of surgeons to do this,"" he said. ""It has the potential to change so many people's lives. ""It's great to be able to help people in such a dramatic fashion."" Mr Ghaffar said that, thanks to the operation, he could now live a ""relatively normal life"". ""I am driving, I go to college, I make friends, I go out with them. I do everything every able-bodied person is able to do,"" he said. He said the surgery surpassed his expectations.

It is not thought every one of the countries, which are largely from Europe and the Commonwealth, would necessarily send troops but some could provide other support. The plan, spearheaded by the UK and France, was set out by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at this weekend's summit of 18 European and Canadian leaders, and would work to uphold any ceasefire in Russia's war on Ukraine. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said such a move ""can't be allowed"" because it would amount to the ""direct, official and unveiled involvement of Nato members in the war against Russia"". It comes as Kyiv attempts to mend relations with Washington after the US paused its military aid to Ukraine and intelligence sharing in a bid to bring President Zelensky to the negotiating table. Speaking on a visit to a defence firm in Merseyside, Sir Keir said it would be a ""big mistake"" to think that ""all we've got to do is wait for a deal now"" between Ukraine and Russia, which US President Donald Trump claims to be attempting to broker. The PM said it would be crucial that ""if there is a deal - and we don't know there will be - that we defend the deal"", which meant ensuring Ukraine was ""in the strongest position"". But the PM stressed that defence plan should be made ""in conjunction with the United States... it's that ability to work with the United States and our European partners that has kept the peace for 80 years now"". It is understood a meeting of officials was held on Tuesday to discuss providing security guarantees following any peace deal. British officials said it was ""early days"" but welcomed what they described as the expressions of interest in joining a ""coalition of the willing"" as a ""highly positive step"". The Prime Minister's Deputy Official Spokesman said the government had been ""very clear that it is for Europe and for the UK to step up and I think you are seeing evidence of that consistently."" The UK and France have proposed a one-month truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"", backed up by a coalition of supportive western countries, but this has been rejected by Russia. The UK announced a £1.6bn missile deal for Ukraine on Sunday and has now signed another deal with an Anglo-American security firm Anduril, to provide Ukraine with more advanced attack drones. Also on Thursday, Defence Secretary John Healey held talks with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth in Washington DC. At the meeting, Healey said the US had challenged Europe to step up on defence spending and the UK had responded. ""We have, we are and we will further,"" he said. Hegseth said the UK was a ""critical"" partner, adding European leadership of the Nato alliance was ""the future of defence on the continent"". Earlier, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed another security deal, worth nearly £30m and backed by the International Fund for Ukraine. The deal will see Kyiv supplied with cutting-edge Altius 600m and Altius 700m systems - designed to monitor an area before striking targets that enter it - to help tackle Russian aggression in the Black Sea. The announcement comes amid concerns that the US move to halt intelligence-sharing with Ukraine will affect the country's ability to use western weaponry and deprive it of advanced information about incoming threats. In Brussels, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, held an emergency defence summit as the EU grapples with the prospect of Trump reducing security assistance for Europe.",,,,"About 20 countries could join Ukraine coalition, UK says","Jennifer McKiernan, Political reporter, BBC News•@_JennyMcKiernan, •",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Five members of a German far-right group have been jailed for plotting to overthrow the government and kidnap its health minister. Four of the group were described as ""ringleaders"" of a ""terrorist organisation"" which planned to use violence to trigger civil war-like conditions in Germany. The group had planned to kidnap Health Minister Karl Lauterbach - an advocate of strict Covid-19 measures during the pandemic - and to kill his bodyguards if necessary. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the defendants had posed ""an enormous threat"" to national security. The Koblenz higher regional court heard the group came together in January 2022 and devised a plan which included a sabotage attack to disable the power grid. The group - made up of four men aged between 46 and 58 and a 77-year-old woman - had hoped they would be joined by disgruntled members of the security forces. Four defendants described as ringleaders were sentenced to between five years and nine months and eight years in jail by a court in western Germany. A fifth defendant received a two year and 10 month sentence following the almost two-year trial. The identities of the five people convicted have not been publicly disclosed. The group were associated with Citizens of the Reich whose followers believe the German Empire, which collapsed in 1918, continues to exist. Investigators say it was led by Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, a German aristocrat. They are also said to have taken inspiration from the QAnon conspiracy theory movement, which is associated with some Donald Trump's supporters in the US. After the verdict, Lauterbach - of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) - thanked the police and said the state had shown ""it can defend itself against violent conspiracy theorists"".",,,,Five jailed over plot to kidnap German minister,"André Rhoden-Paul, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right. As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence. Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours. In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant. From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent – whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security. France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines. The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign – i.e. developed entirely by France – whereas the UK relies on US technical input. On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could – in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries. His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering ""sharing"" its nuclear arsenal. That – according to government officials as well as defence experts – is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be ""shared"". According to Defence Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent ""is French and will remain French – from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president."" What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries. Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the ""vital interests"" of France were at stake. The limits of these ""vital interests"" have always been left deliberately vague – ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence. In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany. So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent. What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it. ""In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,"" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille. ""They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato."" ""But Trump has clarified the debate,"" Mr Laroche says. ""It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent – let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now."" ""But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella."" Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject. How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear. According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal. Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency. Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not – but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that ""vital interests"" cover European allies too. Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent. But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries. ""If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,"" he says. ""In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others – that helps create a solid front.""",,,,France has a nuclear umbrella.

,,,reliable,,"A man and woman have been found guilty of murdering a 66-year-old man who was thrown over cliffs along the Wild Atlantic Way. Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both denied the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023. The body of the County Tyrone man was found eight days later in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. It is not known if he was dead or alive when pushed. His body was found following a search involving gardaí (Irish police), the Donegal Mountain Rescue Team and the Irish Coastguard. The trial had previously heard Vial, Burns and Mr Wilkin had been drinking at various bars on the night of the murder. CCTV footage shown during the trial showed a car travelling from McIntyre's Bar in Dunkineely to Roshine, which a prosecutor said was most likely the place where Mr Wilkin was assaulted. The Irish state pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, had told the trial that she was unable to identify a cause of death due to the body's state of decomposition and the damage caused by the fall down the cliff face. However, she did identify two depressed fractures to the back of the victim's skull which were not consistent with a fall down a cliff. The prosecution case was that Mr Wilkin was beaten with a rock before being driven to Slieve League and put over the cliffs. Prosecutors also said the victim was either thrown over the cliff ""alive or dead"". They had argued that Burns and Vial acted together as a joint enterprise, meaning they were both equally responsible, regardless of who struck the fatal blow. During the trial, the two accused each other of the murder. The trial had been told that all three became friends just weeks before the murder and they had lived together at times in Vial's house in Killybegs. Vial and Burns had been in a brief relationship in the time leading up to the killing of Mr Wilkin. Vial, who was described by his barrister as ""a petty criminal and an alcoholic"", had pleaded not guilty to the murder. Burns, who the court heard had ""a difficult upbringing"", also pleaded not guilty to murder, but she pleaded guilty to impeding the apprehension or prosecution of another person for an arrestable offence. Mr Wilkin's body was discovered following a huge land, sea and air search along the County Donegal coastline involving search and rescue helicopters, boats, drones, the Irish defence forces, and a large number of people from local communities. The search began after a car in which the two killers were travelling crashed the evening after the victim was murdered and Vial was arrested for drink driving. The crash and Vial's arrest, along with admissions made by Burns to friends that evening, quickly led to a major police operation at the cliffs. After a lengthy trial which began in January, the jury took just over eight-and-a-half hours across three days to reach their verdicts. The seven women and five men found both Vial and Burns guilty of murder.

Last December, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail for drugging his ex-wife, Gisèle, raping her and inviting dozens of men to also abuse her over nearly a decade. Pelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he neatly catalogued on a hard disk. Among them were also two photos of his daughter, in which Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious, sleeping in an unfamiliar position and wearing underwear she doesn't recognise. Dominique Pelicot has offered conflicting explanations for the photos, but has always denied sexually assaulting his daughter. Ms Darian has long said the photos are proof her father also drugged and raped her. ""I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence,"" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. Police will now launch an investigation, and prosecutors will later decide whether to proceed to trial. Béatrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was ""unsurprising"". But she also pointed out that the prosecutors in the previous trial had said there were insufficient ""objective elements"" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter. The heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world.

,,,reliable,,"A judge has said he is satisfied Conor McGregor has done what was ordered regarding the sharing of CCTV footage, which was shown during the civil trial brought by Nikita Hand. In January, Judge Alex Owens ordered the former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter not to share the footage and to give back or destroy any copies. The judge said the jury in the civil trial conclusively determined Mr McGregor raped Ms Hand in a Dublin hotel in December 2018. He said it was not open to McGregor to selectively use evidence in the public arena to suit himself. The footage showed McGregor, Ms Hand and two others, James Lawrence and Danielle Kealy, in the car park and lift of the Beacon Hotel in Dublin, before and after McGregor assaulted Ms Hand. It was played to the court on multiple occasions during the trial and viewed by the jury during their deliberations. McGregor had claimed Ms Hand did not look like someone who had been seriously assaulted in the footage. Ms Hand became very upset when it was shown in court and said she was clearly very drunk in the footage. On Thursday, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that lawyers for Ms Hand asked the judge to issue an injunction against McGregor, which they said would further restrain him from publishing or sharing the footage. Ms Hand's senior counsel, John Gordon, said McGregor was not clear enough in his affidavits to the court and that he would have expected McGregor to address a specific issue about causing anybody to receive the footage. Mr Gordon referred to a newspaper article which referenced a claim by an Italian business associate of McGregor, Gabriel Ernesto Rapisarda, who claimed after the trial that the imminent release of the footage would increase sales of McGregor's stout. However, the judge said he had to rely on affidavits from people and, according to McGregor's affidavit, he had taken the steps asked of him and that any urgency in January had now blown over. The judge said McGregor was the ""author of his own misfortune"" by sharing a social media post and that he was satisfied with the affidavits. Senior counsel Remy Farrell, for McGregor, agreed with the judge that his client had done everything he was asked to do. The judge awarded costs for this action against McGregor. Ms Hand, who accused McGregor of raping her, took a claim against him and another man, Mr Lawrence, for damages in a civil case. In the Irish courts, a civil action means - unlike a criminal case - there is no automatic anonymity for either the complainant or the accused. McGregor was ordered to pay her more than €248,000 (£206,000) in damages after a jury found he had sexually assaulted Ms Hand. The jury found that Mr Lawrence did not assault her. Speaking outside the court following the decision, Ms Hand said her story was ""a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be to speak up, you have a voice"". A judge later ruled that the MMA star must pay Ms Hand's legal costs.

In February, Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,052) for that offence but found not guilty of coercion over allegations he pressured Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss was consensual. Prosecutors have called for Rubiales to be jailed and appealed that verdict, seeking a retrial with a different judge after alleging the original was biased in Rubiales's favour. Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips as Spain's players received their medals for winning the 2023 World Cup. The incident, which occurred after Spain defeated England in Sydney, was witnessed by millions on television and in the stadium, and triggered protests and calls for Rubiales's resignation. The 47-year-old previously said he will appeal against the guilty verdict. Three of Rubiales's former colleagues were also accused of colluding in the alleged coercion. Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rubén Rivera, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF)'s former head of marketing, and Albert Luque, former sporting director, were all cleared. The court's ruling also banned the former football president from going within a 200m radius of Hermoso or communicating with her for one year. During the trial, Rubiales told the court he was ""absolutely sure"" Hermoso had given her consent before he kissed her.

Spent smoke bombs, smears of egg yolk and a dusting of white fire extinguisher powder had all been removed from the benches and tables after the mayhem of the previous day. The police had also been on the scene. They were gathering evidence for potential criminal charges against the MPs who had plunged the parliament into a fug of pink and black smoke as they unfurled banners accusing the government of corruption. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic labelled the scenes ""hooliganism"". He said he was ""looking for responsibility, criminal law"" to be applied. Three female MPs were hurt. One of them was hit on the back of the head by an object, although it was unclear who threw it, and another apparently suffered a stroke. The EU said a parliament should be a place for democratic debate and that it was very concerned. Opposition party MPs were unabashed. The co-leader of the Green-Left Front, Radomir Lazovic, had let off a fire extinguisher from his seat in the chamber. He described the intervention as ""a response to the violence that has been perpetrated against the citizens of Serbia for 13 years"". That covers the period that the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has been in power. Under the leadership of Vucic - who previously served as deputy prime minister and prime minister - the party has been an election-winning machine. The SNS has emerged victorious from no fewer than five parliamentary elections since it first formed a governing coalition in 2012. Its opponents claim that has more to do with the party's domination of Serbia's media outlets and state institutions than its policies. But Vucic has successfully projected an image of strong, effective leadership that appeals to a large proportion of Serbia's electorate - particularly outside the main urban areas. He has weathered plenty of protest movements over the years. All of them have fizzled out without dislodging the president or his party. But the current series of rallies, demonstrations and blockades is presenting an unusually tricky challenge. The outpouring of outrage started with November's disaster at Novi Sad railway station - when a concrete canopy collapsed at the recently-renovated facility, killing 15 people. The station was part of the government's flagship infrastructure project - the high-speed railway linking the capital, Belgrade, to Budapest in Hungary. The fatal failure at such a high-profile site caused anguish and anger - and stoked suspicions that official corruption was behind the collapse. Students have been leading the calls for transparency and accountability, holding daily 15-minute vigils for the dead. But workers, ranging from lawyers to farmers, have also been staging strikes and blocking roads. ""Everyone has a reason to be unhappy,"" says analyst and journalist Bojan Elek. ""Terrible salaries, poor working conditions - everyone had something to add to the huge dissatisfaction that's in the population. ""But the students have been the key cohesive factor."" What the students have not been is political. They have kept opposition parties and NGOs away from their increasingly elaborate events, which have seen them take over the city centres of Novi Sad and Nis in recent weeks. Mr Elek describes this as ""a good move"" - but notes that ""at some point, politics will have to come into play"". What that might look like is not yet clear. Opposition parties are atomised - with no one single party capable of challenging the SNS, and an absence of a credible coalition. They have at least been united in their calls for the establishment of a technical government following the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January. This could, they suggest, establish an electoral environment that would reduce the SNS's domination of the media and state bodies. Vucic has rejected that idea as an opposition attempt to overthrow a legitimately elected government. He may appoint a replacement prime minister or call fresh elections, even though the previous polls were held as recently as December 2023. Meanwhile, the protests continue.

James Scott Rhys Anderson was reportedly captured in Russia's Kursk region last November, where Ukraine had launched a cross-border incursion, and was charged with terrorism and mercenary activity. The 22-year-old is the first British national to be convicted by Russia during the war. The UK Foreign Office said Mr Anderson was sentenced on ""false charges"" and described him as a prisoner of war. A statement released by the Russian court claimed Mr Anderson had pleaded guilty but this cannot be verified, as he has not been heard from independently since he was taken. On Wednesday, a Russian military court ruled that Mr Anderson would spend the first five years of his sentence in prison before being transferred to a penal colony with ""strict"" conditions. Russian investigators had accused him of ""committing a terrorist act"" as part of an organised group, illegally crossing the border into Russia, causing ""significant damage to property"" and having ""destabilised"" the activities of authorities.

""The president behaved with dignity"" said former MP Boryslav Bereza, who described Zelensky's softening of tone as an ""apology"". Last night, Ukraine's leader gave his evening address from the courtyard outside Kyiv's Presidential Office. It was the same spot where he gave the now famous ""we are all here"" speech with his cabinet on the second day of Russia's invasion. Back then, he'd turned down offers to leave. Many in the West expected Russia to be in the capital within days, with the president being captured or killed. Three years on, it seems his choice to keep fighting has gradually been taken away from him. He said he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" and that it was ""time to make things right"". Washington's hostile rhetoric, that Oval Office meeting and the ""pausing"" of US military aid have forced him to bend to Trump's peace vision. Up until last week, Zelensky had held firm that Ukraine would only agree to peace if its security was guaranteed, otherwise it would fight on. He also accused Trump of living in a ""disinformation space"" after the US president repeated some of Moscow's claims. All of this served as a prelude to Friday's fiery exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, who accused Zelensky of having ""disrespected"" the US and ultimately told him to leave. The Ukrainian leader had a warmer reception from European leaders at the weekend - but while they pledged to help secure Ukraine in the future, they made clear peace would still require US involvement. Then, on Tuesday, Trump paused US military aid to Ukraine, raising concerns it may only be able to hold out for a matter of months - and leaving Zelensky to make his peace with the situation. In a letter to the US president, he even gave specifics on what the first stage of a peace process could involve, including a naval and aerial ceasefire - proposals first suggested by France's President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend. Trump said he appreciated the letter, in a sign of cooling tensions between the two leaders, and that Zelensky had agreed to strike a peace deal. What is more telling is Zelensky's willingness now to sign a mineral deal without the security guarantees he is hoping for - and had portrayed as essential until very recently. The US has suggested the presence of US companies mining for natural resources would be enough to put Russia off breaking a ceasefire. However, American businesses didn't exactly put Moscow off from launching its full-scale invasion. What's even more telling are the lack of compromises Russia would seemingly have to make in any peace agreement. Perhaps Zelensky has run out of political road, and with his European allies acknowledging that they still need the US, Washington seems still to be the only place for him to turn to.",,,,Zelensky's conciliatory letter to Trump suggests he's out of options,"James Waterhouse, BBC Ukraine correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal.

,,,reliable,,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%.

,,,reliable,,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"".",,,,Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,"Paul Kirby, Europe digital editor",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Ireland is in a ""serious period of reform"" when it comes to defence and security, the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) has said. Earlier on Tuesday, the Irish Cabinet approved draft legislation to change the rules that govern how its military can be used abroad. The reforms include changes to what it known as 'the triple lock', requiring the approval of the United Nations (UN), government and Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament) for certain troop deployments. Under existing rules, 12 members of the Irish Defence Forces can be sent on an overseas mission without triggering the lock. The proposed change would mean removing the need for UN approval and raising to 50 the number of troops that can be deployed without sign off from the Dáil. Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ's Six One news programme, Simon Harris said the removal of the triple lock system is about ""sovereignty"". ""We have a very proud track record in the country of peacekeeping,"" he added. ""But the idea that any permanent member of the security council can have a veto, including Vladimir Putin, on where our defence forces go is not democratic."" The foreign affairs minister said it was ""important"" for decisions on peacekeeping to be taken in Ireland. Asked if the removal of the triple lock threatened Ireland's policy of military neutrality, Harris said that was something ""extraordinarily important"" to the Irish people. ""We do also need to spend more on defence because actually when you are militarily neutral, you still have an obligation to your own people, to your own country, you still have an obligation to protect your own seas and your own skies,"" he said. ""We are in an era now of significant investment in defence... but all of that very much aligned with military neutrality."" Earlier, Taoiseach (prime minister) Micheál Martin said that Russia and China should not have a veto on where Irish troops are sent. ""This is about exercising our own sovereignty,"" he added. Sinn Féin have described the move as an ""abandonment"" of Ireland's policy of neutrality. Sinn Féin TD (MP) Pearse Doherty said ""the Irish people are against it"", and called for a referendum on the issue. The move comes as the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to give member states more fiscal space for defence investments, as well as €150 billion (£124bn) in loans for those investments. Earlier on Tuesday, the US announced it would pause military aid to Ukraine. ""We are in an era of rearmament, and Europe is massively ready to boost its defence spending, both to respond to the short-term urgency to act and to support Ukraine, but also to address the long-term need to take on more responsibility for our own European security,"" von der Leyen said. Earlier, Brig Gen Rossa Mulcahy was appointed as the next Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces. Announcing the appointment, the Defence Forces said that Brig Gen Mulcahy has more than 35 years of experience across a variety of roles, both at home and overseas. He has served in deployments to Lebanon, Syria and Afghanistan with the United Nations and NATO. Since 2021, he has held the role of assistant chief of staff and he is due to take up the new appointment on 1 June. The announcement follows the Irish government's nomination of the outgoing chief, Seán Clancy, as chair of the EU Military Committee.

,,,reliable,,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.",,,,Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,"Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion three years ago. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine, but Ukrainian forces have made those advances as slow and difficult as possible and have staged a counter-offensive into Russian territory. Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine. In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Donbas, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns. Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. Ukrainian military intelligence says about 620,000 Russian soldiers are operating in Ukraine and Kursk, according to experts at the Institute for the Study of War. They also expect Russian forces to focus on seizing frontline Ukrainian towns and cities over the winter. The Russian recently took the town of Kurakhove and have continued advancing to the north east, towards the city of Pokrovsk, where they have been met by Ukrainian forces. The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months, but innovative tactics by Ukrainian forces, combining the use of drones and ground forces, have inflicted significant losses of troops and equipment and slowed the offensive. It has taken a year for Russia's troops to advance about 40km (25 miles) west - Ukraine was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, in February 2024 after months of fighting. Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed. In addition to its operation on the eastern front, Russia began what the ISW describes as its ""subordinate main effort"" when it crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in May 2024. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled. The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress which was resolved last April. Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery. Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia had already seized the southern peninsula of Crimea in February 2014 before annexing it soon afterwards. Trump has said it is unlikely Ukraine will return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said ""some of that land will come back"". In an interview with the Guardian, published on 11 February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region in recent months as part of a peace deal. Ukraine seized control of part of the region in a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region. Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government, and Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"". After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. Some of that territory has been regained by Russia but Ukraine still has troops in the Kursk region. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov described Zelensky's suggestion of a territory swap as ""impossible"". Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition. Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance. By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson. Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, with at least 70,000 Russian troops killed - and an estimated 500,000 being either killed or injured in total, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Doctors were forced to intervene to clear mucus from the Pope's lungs, an update from the Holy See said, though it said he was alert throughout. The 88-year-old pontiff has resumed the use of an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing, but remains ""alert, focused and cooperative"", the Vatican said. This is now the third serious downturn since the 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to hospital 18 days ago with pneumonia. On Friday, Pope Francis suffered an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting, the Vatican said. Updates from the Holy See reported that he responded well to oxygen therapy, with Vatican officials saying on Sunday the Pope no longer required ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy"". Following Monday's episodes, Pope Francis has resumed that mechanical ventilation. His illness has meant that Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person for three weeks in a row, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead. Officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written ""in the past few days"". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. He will also miss the procession and mass this Wednesday that mark the first day of Lent, the six-week period leading to Easter. Hundreds of Catholics gathered outside in St Peter's Square on Monday for an eighth evening to pray for the Pope's health, many carrying rosary beads as they headed across the cobbles towards the Basilica. The crowd, a mixture of priests and nuns based in Rome and Catholic pilgrims here for a Jubilee year, were led by an American cardinal.

,,,reliable,,"A statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying a deal to end the war with Russia was ""very far away"" has drawn a furious response by Donald Trump. ""America will not put up with it for much longer,"" the US president said in a social media post, before accusing Zelensky of not wanting peace. A summit of mostly European leaders in London on Sunday agreed a four-point plan to guarantee Ukraine's defence in the event of a peace deal with Russia. ""Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?"" Trump said, apparently referring to the summit held two days after his fiery clash with Zelensky at the Oval Office. The summit - hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine and an attempt to reduce differences between Western countries over Ukraine. Britain and France said they were working on a European-led solution to the conflict. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". He added that he expected the US to continue backing Ukraine despite his own fraught relations with Trump. ""I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America,"" Zelensky said late on Sunday. But on Monday, Trump responded by reiterating his view that Zelensky stood in the way of peace negotiations. ""This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer! It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing,"" he wrote on his Truth Social media network. During a news briefing later on Monday, Trump once again said that Zelensky ""should be more appreciative"" for the aid he has received from the US in the three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the confrontation in front of cameras at the White House, both Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance expressed anger at what they perceived as Zelensky's lack of gratitude. ""Just say thank you,"" Vance demanded at one point. The angry exchange meant that a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals was left unsigned. In his news conference on Monday, Trump said he did not believe the agreement was dead. He added that he would provide an update on the minerals deal late on Tuesday. After the London summit, the UK and France suggested a European ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - and to make sure Russia would not invade after a peace deal. Sir Keir said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have signalled they were open to the idea if it had the backing of the US. The European moves follow a reversal of US policy under President Trump. He says he wants to end the war and has held a lengthy telephone conversation with Putin and a round of talks with Moscow to which Ukraine was excluded.

The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle.",,,,What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,"Frank Gardner, Security correspondent, BBC News",,,,,,,1

In 2022, the pair were acquitted in a trial over a payment of 2m Swiss francs (£1.6m) made to Platini and authorised by Blatter in 2011. Both men denied wrongdoing and said the transfer was belated payment for Fifa advisory work by Platini, who formerly led European football's governing body Uefa. But the Swiss federal prosecutor appealed against the decision. The new trial is expected to last until Thursday, with a verdict due on 25 March. The pair appeared before an appeals court in Muttenz, near Basel, on Monday. Blatter, 88, reaffirmed that he was innocent. ""When you talk about falsehoods, lies and deception, that's not me. That didn't exist in my whole life,"" he told the court. A lawyer for Platini, 69, said the lower court that acquitted the pair in 2022 had been ""right to find that the disputed payment of 2m francs was lawful"". Platini had an illustrious playing career and is a three-time winner of the Ballon d'Or - Europe's highest individual football award. He captained France to victory at the 1984 European Championship and won the 1985 European Cup with Juventus. He went on to coach the French national team and became Uefa president in 2007. In 2015, prosecutors accused the pair of deceiving Fifa about payments made to Platini. In his testimony at the first trial, Blatter said that he had asked Platini to work as his adviser in 1998.

,,,reliable,,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

As the Ukrainian president arrived at the King's Norfolk residence, local residents, some holding Ukraine flags, gathered outside the estate to witness his entrance by helicopter. Zelensky was in London over the weekend for the talks on European defence, after a fiery exchange with US President Donald Trump in the White House on Friday. Ukraine's president was ""warmly received"", and the meeting lasted just under an hour, royal sources said. The pair were served tea in Sandringham's Saloon room. Zelensky described it as ""a very good meeting"". ""I'm very grateful for this meeting and for how His Majesty helps Ukraine and supports us,"" he told reporters. ""He's met our warriors here, being trained in the UK, and we're very thankful to the Royal Family for their support."" The King has previously expressed support for Zelensky and Ukraine, saying the country had experienced ""indescribable aggression"" following Russia's ""unprovoked attack on their land"". The Ukrainian people have shown ""truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy"", the King said last year. They first met at Buckingham Palace during Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK in 2023, and the same day the King visited Ukrainian troops being trained in Wiltshire. Today's meeting was requested by the Ukrainian president, with the agreement of the UK government. After the summit had concluded, Sir Keir unveiled a four-step plan world leaders hope will guarantee peace in Ukraine. These steps include keeping military aid flowing and the creation of a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. Sunday's meeting in Norfolk has allowed Zelensky to meet the King well before Trump's second state visit to the UK, which was offered when Sir Keir presented the US president with an invitation letter from the monarch during a visit to Washington last week. While the Ukrainian leader's visit is an official one, it is less formal than a state visit. Traditionally, second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle. Sir Keir said Trump's last state visit in 2019 had been a ""tremendous success"" and that the invite for a second visit was ""truly historic"" and ""unprecedented"". Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an ""honour"" to visit the ""fantastic"" country. When the trip will take place has yet to be announced. Sir Keir dismissed calls by SNP first minister John Swinney to cancel the invite to Trump after his disastrous Oval Office meeting with Zelensky - in which he accused the Ukrainian leader of ""gambling with World War Three"".",,,,Warm reception for Zelensky as he meets King at Sandringham,"Tom McArthur, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Lancaster House may have been bathed in sunshine as European leaders gathered to chart a way forward for Ukraine. But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London. It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine? The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US. He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's ""armed forces and border defences"" to ensure that ""Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,"" according to the official conclusions of the summit. And Sir Keir said there would be a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace. Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be ""a force consisting of European and other partners"". The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders"". The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop. The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace. Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly ""to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing"". This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky. The Europeans also wanted to find ways of repairing the transatlantic alliance, which is looking pretty fragile after the confrontation between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday. In recent weeks, the US administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and - in the form of the president's chief enforcer, Elon Musk - saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trump's desire to find a ceasefire. But Europe stepping up is only half of the story and much depends on whether the US is willing to play its part. Diplomats say the US is willing to de-escalate the tensions with Zelensky, but there were mixed messages on Sunday. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire. So the outcome of the Lancaster House summit was seemingly a united European front in backing Zelensky, with the promise of more military support for Ukraine to come. But the cloud lurking in the London skies remains what the United States does next. And that is not yet clear.

Vatican officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written ""in the past few days"". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. ""I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.""

In his latest written address, the Pope told Catholics that he felt their ""affection and closeness"" and felt ""carried and supported by all God's people"". The Vatican said he remained stable on Sunday, although doctors still describe his overall condition - with pneumonia - as ""complex"" and the risk of another infection is high. After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis. The medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials.

Mauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Joël Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday. Le Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperlé. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastrointestinal surgeon - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks. It turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever. ""The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone,"" she tells the BBC. There is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres. Then, in 2018, police knocked on his door. They told him a man named Joël Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them. Mauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay. ""Then they left.

Then again, he doesn't really need to say anything. President Putin can afford to sit back and watch events unfold. Donald Trump predicted that the very public spat with President Zelensky was ""going to be great television"". There's little doubt that Vladimir Putin will have enjoyed the ""show"", the dramatic spectacle of Volodymyr Zelensky, leader of the country President Putin invaded, being berated by the president and vice-president of the United States in front of the world's media.

In a post on social media, former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Russian security council, wrote that President Zelensky had received ""a slap down in the Oval Office"". He called on the US to stop military assistance to Ukraine. How Moscow would welcome that. Writing on Telegram, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised Trump and JD Vance for their ""miracle of restraint"" at not hitting Ukraine's president. It's a sign of the new world in which we seem to be now that, while US-Ukraine relations are at risk of implosion, the opposite is true for US-Russia ties. In recent weeks, Trump and Putin have spoken on the phone and pledged to work closely together; there's talk of a possible summit sometime soon; lower-level US-Russia talks to reset relations and discuss potential economic cooperation have already started. President Putin has dangled the carrot of lucrative joint projects with the Americans involving rare earth minerals and aluminium production. The implications of a breakdown in relations between Ukraine and the US are potentially very serious for Kyiv, but very positive for Moscow. If the flow of American weapons to Ukraine were to stop, it would be much harder for Ukrainians to defend themselves against the Russian forces who have invaded their country, even if Ukraine enjoys solidarity and strong support from European leaders.

Much of the world rallied behind him - he received several standing ovations after his address to the US Congress asking for American support. But just three years later, he finds himself in uncertain territory, with US President Donald Trump calling him a dictator and the US siding with Russia in votes at the UN to mark the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. Zelensky's trip to Washington at the end of February, during which he was expected to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources with the US, ended in acrimony. He was told to leave the White House after an angry exchange with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. Zelensky's arrival on the political scene was a case of life imitating art. Ironically, Zelensky's most celebrated role as a comic actor was playing a school teacher who was catapulted into the presidency on the TV series, Servant of the People. Cut to real life, and his election candidacy, aged 41, was initially seen by some as a joke - his political party is even called Servant of the People. But he won with a landslide 73% of the vote, promising to fight corruption and bring peace in the east of Ukraine. Sceptics feared Zelensky would turn out to be a puppet leader, controlled by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who backed his campaign and had been under investigation for fraud and money laundering. But Zelensky proved to be more independent than his doubters thought, and the anti-corruption drive by his administration has had some success. Many Ukrainians also viewed Zelensky's rhetoric on the conflict in the eastern Donbas region and relations with Russia as too timid, says communications consultant Yaryna Klyuchkovska. As the drumbeat of war grew louder, Zelensky continued to emphasise his hopes for a diplomatic solution, even while Ukraine was reporting a rapid increase in ceasefire violations along the front line. His attempts to negotiate with Russia had only limited success. There were prisoner exchanges and moves towards implementing parts of a peace process, known as the Minsk agreements, but no breakthrough. Throughout 2020 his approval rating steadily fell. There was a notable shift in tone at the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, when Zelensky laid bare the threat his country was facing, and accused the West of appeasing a resurgent Russia. No Ukrainian leader had spoken so bluntly to the West before, according to Ms Klyuchkovska. Then, on 24 February 2022 - just hours before Russia first began bombarding Ukraine's cities - came a key moment. In a sober address posted on social media, speaking partly in Russian, Zelensky said he had tried to call Vladimir Putin to avert a war, and had been met by silence. The two countries didn't need a war, he said, but if Ukrainians came under attack they would defend themselves. ""When you attack us you will see our faces - not our backs, but our faces."" For his next broadcast after Russia had invaded, he wore military fatigues, reflecting the country's David-versus-Goliath struggle. That evening he made another address, warning Western leaders that if they did not help, tomorrow ""war will knock on your doors"". Zelensky's nightly video addresses became a source of hope and comfort for millions of Ukrainians during the ongoing fighting. His ability to connect was perhaps most evident when he posted a defiant video of himself with several top advisers in Kyiv, after Russia falsely claimed he had fled the capital. ""We are here,"" he repeated. ""We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine."" Zelensky quickly became a national figurehead, with a high of 90% approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. The war has understandably taken an emotional toll on Zelensky's family. His wife, Olena Zelenska, and their two children spent months living in secret locations for their own safety. The four have spent very little time together since the start of the conflict. Further afield, Zelensky has seen it as his mission to galvanise support for Ukraine, leaning on his western allies to provide aid and fast-track his country's membership of Nato. In between visits to the front line, he has spoken with foreign leaders to lobby support and attended conferences across the globe, pleading for help. One of the most striking and enduring images from the early months of the war was his visit in April 2022 to the outer Kyiv suburb town of Bucha - where Russian troops are suspected of committing hundreds of war crimes. His first foreign trip after the invasion came in December 2022 when he went to the US to visit then-President Joe Biden - unsurprising given Washington had been Kyiv's largest backer.",,,,Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky: The comedian who became a wartime leader,"Stephen Mulvey & James Gregory, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"These were already turbulent times in Romania. But as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake. A country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them. Was a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet? Or are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic? As foreign leaders – from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer – travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side? ""It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,"" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. Declining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages – commercial, diplomatic, and military – of continuing to back it. But if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed. This is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens – a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union. So, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money. ""For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,"" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of ""external influence."" ""It's my personal perception that probably there is… pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),"" said international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca. It is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. Many in the so-called ""manosphere"" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches. There is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance. But the picture is not clear cut. President Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are ""not welcome"" in his state, amid plans to open a ""preliminary inquiry"" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women. Meanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts. ""I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,"" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a ""coherent"" policy concerning the Tates. ""I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,"" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level ""satellite"" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order ""to extract money from the Tate brothers."" The BBC has seen no evidence of this. ""It's very depressing to see,"" he added. As for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures. The fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a ""conspiracy"" against them. And while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face ""no active indictment"" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending. ""In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,"" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. The brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases. In the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate – often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order. With their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. Clearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",,,,Were Tate brothers released in secret deal - or is the truth far more chaotic?,"Andrew Harding, BBC News, Reporting fromBucharest",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"On France's northern coast, they call the people smuggling and dangerous dinghies phenomenon, La Crise Migratoire. But do the UK and France now have a chance of consigning the small boats to history? Somewhat eclipsed by events this week in Washington, Yvette Cooper became the first British home secretary in five years to go to the French coast to see for herself how £540m of British taxpayers' money is being used to tackle people smuggling gangs. She was the guest of her French counterpart, interior minister Bruno Retailleau. The fact that he invited his British opposite number to the frontline of a deeply sensitive problem for both countries speaks volumes. Rather than slinging English Channel mud at each other, this diplomatic rapprochement began with a warm embrace in the cold morning air of Le Touquet airport - and ended with both feeling they may be on the verge of breakthroughs. In the first seven weeks of this year, successful crossings have been down by 41% on the same period of 2024. As the weather improves, both governments know that could be reversed. The optimism comes not from the daily statistics, but what the French and British believe is an increasingly slick coastal operation that may be making it harder for people smugglers to offer crossings to migrants making their way to the coast. The Conservatives maintain there is no real deterrent to come to the Channel - because the government cancelled the deeply controversial Rwanda plan. And everyone who works with refugees says that people in genuine need of protection will have to turn to smugglers until the UK comes up with safe routes for them. The roots of the feeling that things could now change were planted in the 2018 Sandhurst Treaty, signed when the Conservative's Theresa May was prime minister. The UK promised that year to fund coastal security operations against smugglers and this year Paris will receive around £172m.

,,,reliable,,"The taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) has been invited to the White House by US President Donald Trump to celebrate St Patrick's Day next month. The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday. ""I have never met Donald Trump, but I am looking forward to meeting with him,"" Micheál Martin said on RTÉ's The Late Late Show on Friday night. ""We have to keep engaging with the United States,"" he said. The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Martin received the invitation in a letter from the US president. It said Trump's letter congratulated the taoiseach on his recent appointment and highlighted the special bond between the Irish and American people. During Friday night's Late Late Show, Martin also described a clash between the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the US president as ""extraordinary"". The meeting ended early and a planned press conference was cancelled after the two leaders disagreed over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. ""This has been a huge unsettling setback today, there's no question about that,"" Martin said. Martin and Zelensky met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday, where Martin said that Ireland is committed to helping Ukraine financially. It is customary for Irish leaders to travel to the US every March for an audience with the president at the White House. They present their host with a bowl of shamrock - a tradition that dates back to President Harry Truman in 1952. Martin is serving his second term as taoiseach, having previously led his country from June 2020 to December 2022. However, he was not able to visit the White House on St Patrick's Day in 2021 because of Covid travel restrictions. He did make the trip to Washington DC in March 2022 but he could not visit the White House in person because he contracted Covid while in the US. As a result, Martin's previous St Patrick's Day duties as taoiseach consisted of video calls with Trump's predecessor Joe Biden. The annual Washington visit is viewed as an important political opportunity to strengthen US and Irish diplomatic relations and boost cross-Atlantic trade. The Republic of Ireland is particularly vulnerable to threats of US tariffs on European imports and Trump's ""America First"" policy. In 2023, the US was the number-one country for Irish goods exports, buying products worth €54bn. That meant just over a quarter of Irish goods exports were sold into this one market. Earlier this week, Trump said he was planning to impose tariffs of about 25% on goods made in the European Union, of which Ireland is member. On Thursday, the Tánaiste (deputy PM) Simon Harris told the Dáil (Irish Parliament) it has never been a more important time for ministers to travel abroad for talks. Almost 40 Irish ministers and other state officials will make St Patrick's Day trips to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand. Visiting Trump in the White House can also have political perils at home, however, because of his controversial foreign policy announcements. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said they would boycott the White House this St Patrick's Day because of Trump's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Alliance Party has also confirmed they will not attend the events, but Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly is going to Washington DC. Asked about her plans, Little-Pengelly said it was important to ""maintain long and rewarding"" relationships with the US.

,,,reliable,,"A search at a house in Drogheda, County Louth, as part of the investigation into the murder of a six-year-old boy who disappeared more than two years ago, has come to an end. Gardaí (Irish police) said the results of the search are not being released for operational purposes. Kyran Durnin was reported missing at the end of last summer but gardaí believe he may have been killed more than two years earlier. Gardaí commenced a murder investigation in October 2024, saying they were treating Kyran as missing, presumed dead. That same month they carried out a dig at his former family home in Emer Terrace, Dundalk, but there was no sign of his body. On Wednesday, a white cordon was erected around a house on Hand Street in Drogheda. Officers from the Garda Technical Bureau undertook a forensic examination of the property, including the rear garden and a mini-digger was used to excavate land. The search lasted for two days. Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022. He did not return to class after the summer holidays and it is understood authorities were told he was moving to Northern Ireland and to a new school in Newry. Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare and protection, said it received no referrals or concern about Kyran's attendance or educational welfare between 2022 and 2024. In December, two houses were searched in Drogheda. One of the searches involved the use of a cadaver dog. The results of the searches were not made public.

,,,reliable,,"A freight train carrying the highly toxic chemical benzene has derailed in the Czech Republic, sparking a huge fire. Several tankers and a locomotive were ablaze, with firefighters from several regions and a mobile chemical laboratory deployed to the area, according to local media. A massive cloud of dense black smoke was visible for several kilometres. Railway officials say nobody was injured in the incident, which occurred near Hustopeče nad Bečvou, 50km (31 miles) south-west of the Polish border, on Friday. Benzene, which is a cancer-causing substance for humans, is an element present in aircraft fuel. The train ""split apart"" and subsequently derailed, according to initial reports. A nearby electric substation also caught fire, killing power to the nearby town of Hustopeče. Flames up to 20m high were visible when the fire broke out, one eyewitness told the Lidove Noviny newspaper. Dramatic drone footage from the scene, released by the Czech fire service, shows several badly charred and destroyed tankers - some still burning as thick black smoke spews into the sky. Firefighters used heavy foam to prevent the fire spreading further, while other tankers were hosed down to prevent more explosions. A helicopter was also deployed, as well as a special chemical monitoring mobile lab. It took several hours to bring the fire under control, officials said. The fire affected around 15 of the 17 benzene tanks the train had been transporting, a fire department spokesperson told local media. ""The substance should be the same in all tankers, the amount will be specified, but it is approximately 60 tonnes in one tanker. However, this does not mean that everything will burn out or leak,"" Lucie Balážová said. The fire service later said the estimated cost of the damage the fire had caused was 125 million Czech koruna (£4.1m). Locals have been told to stay indoors and not open windows or doors. Officials say air quality ""has not yet exceeded"" any pollution limits, according to Czech news website iDNES. Police say they will investigate the cause of the derailment. Benzene is a colourless or light-yellow liquid with a sweet smell that can evaporate very quickly. It is used in common substances like plastic, resin, nylon and some forms of dyes, pesticides or detergents. It is very flammable. Exposure to benzene through breathing or ingestion can cause symptoms like drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, vomiting or sleeplessness. Very high levels of exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death, according to the CDC. Long-term exposure of a year or more could cause issues with blood, bone marrow or the immune system.",,,,Czech firefighters tackle large toxic train fire,"Tom McArthur, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Greeks have held their largest protests in years and took part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured. In the centre of Athens alone the crowd was put at hundreds of thousands, and big numbers were seen in Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina, as well as many other cities. ""For those of us who had children on that train, a part of our soul remained there and will never return,"" said Maria Karystianou, the head of the Tempi victims' association, whose daughter Marthi was among those killed in the tragedy. An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing. By early afternoon, a group of hooded men began to throw rocks and petrol bombs at police, marring the emotional atmosphere close to parliament. Police in riot gear responded with tear gas and water cannon as clashes went on for some time around the centre of the capital, in Ermou, Omonia and Propylaia. Dozens of people were arrested and the trouble flared up again as evening fell. The violence cast a shadow over the enormous scale of protests in virtually every city in Greece. ""I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice,"" said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens. It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece. The report by Greece's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. ""Those children were killed because the train was not safe,"" said the authority's chief Christos Papadimitriou. The Tempi rail disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials. The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives. Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read ""I have no oxygen - justice to the end"", referring to the 57 who died. Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK. The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa. Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train. In Athens, protesters held placards reading ""My child, call me when you arrive"" and ""No cover-up"". What happened at the Tempi rail disaster? Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. ""I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident"", she told BBC. ""We demand that all the evidence come to light."" Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work. Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square. Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge. In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone's thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night. ""Nothing will ever be the same any more,"" he added, speaking of ""fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state"". In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move ""more dynamically and quickly"" to bring about modern and safe trains. For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances. Thursday's inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy. Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring. ""It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel,"" the report found. ""Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed,"" experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up. Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report. Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and ""landfill"" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene. As he stood in the midst of Friday's protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident.

The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to ""conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially"". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair's US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.

He suffered severe head injuries in the attack and is on life support in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. His father, also named Charles, was assaulted too. His girlfriend of five years, Ms Gallen, described it as a ""a brutal and vicious attack"". ""I feel that it was targeted and organised and they entered the home armed with weapons. They beat him on the back of the head. ""They actually cable tied his sister and threw her in her bedroom.

,,,reliable,,"For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's. To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department. That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. ""In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,"" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",,,,Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?,"Padraig Belton, Technology Reporter",,,,,,,1

Brian McHugh of Cairn Court, Poppintree in Ballymun, had pleaded not guilty to murdering Lisa Thompson, 52, at the house in Sandyhill Gardens, in Dublin. She had been stabbed 11 times in the chest and strangled with a blind cord. A forensic scientist told the Central Criminal Court trial that McHugh's DNA was found on the cord. When asked about the presence of his DNA on the cord, McHugh told gardai that he had been ""in and out"" of Ms Thompson's house ""for the last three years"". The trial also heard evidence that Ms Thompson had been dealing prescription drugs from her home and that she had been in a brief relationship with McHugh. The prosecution argued that McHugh was seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning of 9 May near Ms Thompson's house. Defence counsel for McHugh submitted that this was not ""the neat case wrapped up in a bow"" which the prosecution had presented to the jury. The 12 jurors took three hours and 24 minutes to unanimously reject McHugh's defence. The judge, Ms Justice Karen O'Connor, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the Thompson family and thanked them for their dignity throughout the case. ""I cannot imagine your pain and what you have suffered in terms of your grief,"" she said. McHugh will be sentenced to the mandatory term of life in prison on 10 March.

,,,reliable,,"Irish opposition parties have been branded ""childish"" by the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) after they announced protest action over a long-running row on speaking rights at the Irish parliament. The issue, sparked in January when Ireland's newly-formed coalition government attempted to be formally elected, centres on independent members of the government getting dedicated time in parliament to hold ministers to account. On Thursday, a Dáil (Irish parliament) reform committee voted to allow new speaking slots for those independent members who support the government. However, opposition parties labelled the meeting as ""disgraceful"". The parties - including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Independent Ireland - have announced they will withdraw from pairing arrangements in protest. The speaking rights plan has to be voted through the Dáil before it can proceed but will have sufficient support thanks to the government majority. Pairing is a process where a parliament member of a party abstains from a vote if the member of an opposition party cannot attend. The withdrawal of pairing would negatively affect government business in March when most ministers travel abroad for St Patrick's Day engagements. Almost 40 ministers, junior ministers and other state officials have trips organised to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand. Tánaiste Simon Harris told the Dáil it has never been more important for ministers to travel abroad for discussions, but the withdrawal of pairings will now prevent this. He also defended the government's speaking rights plan, arguing that all Dáil members should be allowed ask questions on behalf of their constituents. But he faced pointed questions from opposition members about what kind of deal the government had done with independents in order to secure their support. The government is seeking to push through a plan to introduce extra speaking time slots in the Dáil for independents who want to question the country's leaders. Some of those independents supported and even helped to negotiate the current programme for government. However, they now want dedicated Dáil time to hold ministers to account, something that opposition parties argue would undermine democracy. The row has been rumbling since January, when loud protests from opposition parties led to turbulent scenes in the Dáil, which had to be repeatedly adjourned. The protests resulted in a one-day delay to the re-election of Micheál Martin as taoiseach (Irish prime minister). In early February, the Ceann Comhairle (parliament speaker) ruled the initial plan - which would have seen those independents treated as part of the opposition for the purposes of speaking time - could not proceed. On Wednesday, the Dáil Reform Committee voted to approve a plan that would see the creation of new question time slots for independent members. Irish national broadcaster RTÉ reported that the government defended the plan in a two-page document circulated to the Dáil Reform Committee, which started a ""modern parliament is not necessarily made up of 'government' and 'opposition' members"". It added ""there are members who can't readily be categorised as such,"" referring to independents who support the government but do not have ministerial posts. It has also said the plan would mean independents have their own speaking time that would not take away from opposition speaking time rights. If voted through, the plan would mean about 60 Dáil members would be allowed to question the taoiseach and the tánaiste on a weekly basis. Harris argued on Thursday that all TDs (Irish parliament members) should be allowed to ask questions on behalf of their constituents and he vowed to defend that right. However opposition parties have been highly critical - in a joint statement they said it was ""another cynical attempt to manipulate speaking time in order to grant special privileges to TDs who were part of negotiating the programme for government and clearly and unambiguously support the government"". Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy said the government was plunging the Dáil into chaos while Labour TD Duncan Smith said the government were ""defending the indefensible"". Martin's Fianna Fáil party won the most seats in November's general election but not enough to form a government on their own. It entered a coalition with Fine Gael and several independents to gain a majority, but some of those independents sought to form a ""technical group"" that would have seen them afforded speaking time and other rights from the opposition benches.",,,,Dáil speaking rights protest branded 'childish',No author available,,,,,,,1

Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal, and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both deny the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023. The body of the County Tyrone man was found in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. On Thursday, Mr Justice Paul McDermott urged the jury to ""proceed with caution"" in respect of Mr Vial's evidence ""in respect of his implication of Ms Burns."" During the trial Mr Vial claimed it was his former lover and co-accused Ms Burns who beat Mr Wilkin to death with a rock and helped put his body over Ireland's tallest cliffs. He insisted he was telling the truth when he said that Ms Burns caused Mr Wilkin's death by twice striking him on the back of the head with a rock and that he did not strike him at all. It is the prosecution case that Mr Vial and Ms Burns were part of a joint enterprise to cause serious harm to Mr Wilkin before putting him over the cliffs. In a statement to Gardai ( Irish police), Ms Burns denied striking Mr Wilkin and described a fight in which her co-accused hit the deceased six or seven times with a rock. She also denied helping to put the body over the cliff but accepted that she had helped to clean Mr Wilkin's blood from the car. Mr Justice McDermott told the jury at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin that Ms Burns' statements to Gardai or others outside court cannot be used as evidence against Mr Vial.

The conservative People's Party (ÖVP), the Social Democrats (SPÖ), and the liberal Neos say they have successfully completed negotiations to form a new administration - a record 151 days since the election was held in September. The leader of the Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPÖ), Herbert Kickl, called the tie-up a coalition of ""losers"" and called for a snap election. Thursday's announcement follows the longest period of coalition negotiations in Austria's recent history, after two previous attempts to form a government failed. The three-party government, which would be the first since the late 1940s, is due to take office next week, if all the parties approve the deal. The biggest hurdle is a vote at a Neos party meeting on Sunday, where a two-thirds majority is needed. The new chancellor will be Christian Stocker of the ÖVP. As he presented the new government programme with the leader of the SPÖ, Andreas Babler, and the Neos, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Stocker said the negotiations had been ""perhaps the most difficult in the history of our country"". But he said they had achieved ""a breakthrough"" that wasn't ""a minimal compromise"". The three parties set out plans to avoid facing a European Union procedure for running an excess budget deficit, with measures including an increased levy on banks. The programme also includes tougher asylum measures, including a temporary stop for family reunifications. Stocker said there would be ""an integration year for refugees"" from day one of their arrival in Austria. The three parties also said they reserved the right to impose an asylum freeze, if numbers of applications increased. They are also planning a headscarf ban for girls under 15.

The Adriana went down in the early hours of 14 June 2023 in international waters – but within Greece's rescue zone - after leaving Libya days earlier. Survivors later told the BBC that coastguards had caused their overcrowded fishing boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent. The Greek coastguard denied these claims and maintains it did not try to rescue those onboard because they were not in danger and said they had voluntarily wanted to reach Italy, not Greece. But in a phone call that's now emerged an unnamed man speaking from inside a Greek rescue coordination centre is heard instructing the captain of the migrant boat to tell an approaching ship that those onboard do not want to reach Greece. The coastguard has not commented on the audio but said it had handed over all available evidence to a Naval Court which is investigating the disaster. The sinking was one of the worst-ever disasters known to have happened in the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off from the port of Tobruk in Libya nearly a week earlier.

,,,reliable,,"Far-right populist Calin Georgescu, who came from nowhere to win the first round of last year's presidential election, has been detained by police and is facing criminal proceedings on a series of charges. Georgescu was stopped in traffic in the capital, Bucharest, on his way to register as a candidate for new elections in May, after last December's second-round run-off was annulled by the constitutional court. Prosecutors said one of the charges involved attempted ""incitement to actions against the constitutional order"". Two right-wing populist parties said they were mobilising their supporters to head for the prosecutor's office, where Georgescu was taken for questioning. Police were seen erecting barriers around the building and hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest. Prosecutors said Georgescu was also being investigated for giving ""false information, false statements"" and for setting up an organisation with ""fascist, racist or xenophobic characteristics"" as well as forming an antisemitic organisation. The severity of the indictment could jeopardise Georgescu's bid to run in the presidential election on 4 and 18 May. He has been placed under judicial control and told not to leave Romania, according to reports. As he left the prosecutor's office, Georgescu told supporters he would continue to fight and that there was ""no difference between the communist mentality and system [that collapsed in 1989] and now"". The original presidential vote was cancelled before the second round last December, after the then president, Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence documents that suggested that hundreds of TikTok accounts had been activated backing Georgescu. Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia had been behind the move, as well as thousands of cyber-attacks and other sabotage. Iohannis had decided to stay in office until a successor was elected, but he resigned earlier this month ahead of an impeachment vote. Opposition politicians had at the time accused Iohannis of an undemocratic move, and Georgescu's communications team repeated the claim against prosecutors. ""Where is democracy now?"" they posted on X on Wednesday, tagging President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and US Vice-President JD Vance. Earlier this month, the US vice-president accused Romania of annulling the elections based on ""flimsy suspicions"" of Romanian intelligence and pressure from its neighbours. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu accused Elon Musk of a ""form of interference"" in Romania's elections, after the billionaire posted several messages of support for Georgescu. Georgescu's hopes of running for the presidency may end up at the constitutional court, which barred another far-right, pro-Russian candidate from running last year. The decision to turn down Diana Sosoaca's candidacy because of her views was widely criticised in Romania. Romania is a vital part of Nato's eastern flank as well as being a member of the European Union. Calin Georgescu has been accused of being pro-Russian and he has praised Romania's fascist and nationalist leaders from the last century as heroes. He denied he was ""Moscow's man"", in a BBC interview last year, but referred to Vladimir Putin as a ""patriot and a leader"" while pointing out ""I am not a fan"".

Thousand gathered at the city's giant Sambadrome arena to watch the top 12 samba schools battle it out for this year's title. Beija-Flor was crowned winner on Wednesday for the 15th time, narrowly beating second-placed Grande Rio. Its performance was an homage to its late director, Luiz Fernando Ribeiro do Carmo, better known as Laíla, who died in June 2021 with Covid-19. While the overarching theme of Beija-Flor's parade was a tribute to its late director, it also featured floats with pyrotechnic displays and dancers dressed as devils. The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges. One of the top 12 samba schools competing for the title was Paraíso do Tuiuti, whose dancers paraded in exuberant feathers. Among the incredible variety of costumes and performances, Vila Isabel's ghosts clad completely in white were a counterpoint to the kaleidoscopic costumes typical of Rio's carnival. Performers from the Grande Rio samba school, which came a close second behind Beija-Flor, kept a watchful eye on the parade. Mocidade delighted spectators with a giant puppet. Many of the Mocidade's dancers wore futuristic costumes, inspired by its theme song, which this year was entitled Back To The Future - There Are No Limits Dreaming. Imperatriz came third this year with a parade which included revellers adorned with gold and white skulls. Portela samba school paid tribute to the legendary Brazilian musician Milton Nascimento.

,,,reliable,,"From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed ""the greatest show on Earth"". But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable. Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival ""is a big part of our culture"" it also has a very negative environmental impact ""from the events, to the textiles, to costumes"" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday. Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy. Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern. To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year. Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused. ""Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,"" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use. The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand. Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (£550), depending on size. Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. ""'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',"" Danni recalls people saying. Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade. Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris – who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.

,,,reliable,,"US President Donald Trump says he will revoke a licence which allowed Venezuela to export some of its oil to the US despite sanctions. The move is a major blow to the Venezuelan government as the licence provided it, through joint ventures between the state-run oil company and US oil giant Chevron, with a crucial income in dollars. Trump said he was revoking the licence - which gave Chevron permission to operate in Venezuela - because the government of Nicolás Maduro had failed to meet ""electoral conditions"" and had not transported ""violent criminals"" deported from the US at a quick enough pace. Venezuela called the decision ""damaging"" and said it could increase migration to the US. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing that he was ""hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolás Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022"". He did not clarify which concessions he was referring to, but the only licence related to Venezuela granted that day was the one issued by the US treasury authorising Chevron to ""resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela"". The licence allowed Chevron to operate joint ventures with Venezuela's state-controlled oil company PDVSA, but barred the US company from paying ""any taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela"". Chevron's spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement on Wednesday that ""Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government"". In a recent interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth argued that if Chevron was forced to pull out of Venezuela, it would allow companies from China and Russia to increase their presence and influence there. He also warned that Venezuela's economy could suffer more if Chevron left the country, which could drive further migration to the US. The Venezuelan opposition, on the other hand, has in the past argued for the licence to be revoked, arguing that it provides the Maduro government with ""a financial lifeline"". The licence was granted in 2022 by the Biden Administration in an attempt to entice the Maduro government to allow free and fair elections. It remained in place even after Venezuela's government-aligned electoral council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential election in July 2024 - a result which has been refuted by the opposition and by a number of countries, including the US, which have recognised Maduro's rival as the legitimate winner instead. President Trump's announcement came less than a month after his envoy, Richard Grenell, met with Nicolás Maduro in Caracas. During his visit, Grenell secured the release of six US citizens who had been held in Venezuela, as well as a deal under which the Maduro government sent planes to the US to fetch deported Venezuelans. In his Truth Social post, Trump said ""the regime has not been transporting the violent criminals that they sent into our Country (the Good Ole' U.S.A.) back to Venezuela at the rapid pace that they had agreed to"". He added he was ""therefore ordering that the ineffective and unmet Biden 'Concession Agreement' be terminated"" as of 1 March. Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez warned that US sanctions had in the past led to an increase of Venezuelans migrating to the US and that this was likely to happen again. Stopping undocumented migration has been one of Trump's main priorities since taking office.

In the capital, Santiago, the entire underground train system was suspended almost immediately. Thousands of people had to be evacuated and stations were plunged into darkness. ""We were like sardines in the dark,"" one passenger described the moment their underground train stalled. Many of those who had been in lifts inside the stations when the power cut happened had to be freed by firefighters. One woman in her 70s was trapped in a lift between two floors in a building in Santiago.

""I'm brave, I told myself 'I'm not going to die here',"" she said. Videos shared on social media also showed metro passengers using their mobile phones' flashlights to find their way out of dark stations. According to Metro de Santiago, the evacuation of the underground was completed 90 minutes after the power cut - but disruption caused by the outage carried on for many more hours.

,,,reliable,,"Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water. This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country. Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year. ""Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,"" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. ""There is a lot of poverty"", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water. Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck. However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say. Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks. It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert. However, Dr Carter says a ""new era"" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed. She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts. From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science. Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",,,,Fog harvesting could provide water for arid cities,"Victoria Gill, Science correspondent, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Brazil's chief prosecutor has accused former President Jair Bolsonaro of leading an attempted coup after the ex-leader was defeated by his left-wing rival in the 2022 presidential election. According to the prosecutor, the alleged plot aimed to prevent Bolsonaro's successor in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office and included a plan to poison Lula. Bolsonaro, 69, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political witch hunt. It is now up to Brazil's Supreme Court to decide whether to accept the prosecutor's charges and put Bolsonaro and 33 others accused on trial. In a sign of how divided Brazil remains two-and-a-half years after the bitterly fought presidential election, critics of Bolsonaro celebrated news of the charges, saying that the former president belonged in jail, while his supporters insisted he was innocent. The focus is now on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who will have to weigh up the merits of the accusations made by the chief prosecutor and decide whether the case should proceed to the trial stage. There is no deadline for Mr Moraes to make his decision, but legal experts quoted in Brazilian media said they expected him to rule in favour of a trial, which could get under way later this year. Political analysts say a potential trial could have an impact on the 2026 presidential election. While Bolsonaro is barred from running for office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he remains a strong political force. Many think he could use a potential trial as a platform for his agenda. In his 272-page report, Attorney-General Paulo Gonet said that he had concluded that Bolsonaro and the 33 other accused had formed a criminal group which had tried to instigate a coup against Lula's newly elected government - an allegation those named have denied. The document alleges that Bolsonaro and his vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto led the group. ""Allied with other individuals, including civilians and military personnel, they attempted to prevent, in a co-ordinated manner, the result of the 2022 presidential elections from being fulfilled,"" it reads. According to the report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the same Supreme Court justice now tasked with deciding whether the case should proceed to trial. The prosecutor's charges are based on a police investigation into the events leading up to 8 January 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people. Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. But the prosecutor's report alleges that he started sowing doubts about Brazil's voting system as early as July 2021, which are thought to have encouraged those storming Congress. Lawyers representing the former president said they were ""astonished"" by the accusations levelled against their client and insisted that he had never supported any movement aimed at dismantling Brazil's democratic rule of law or the institutions that uphold it.

,,,reliable,,"The Mexican army says it has seized more than four tonnes of methamphetamine in raids conducted in the violence-wracked state of Sinaloa over the weekend. Soldiers raided warehouses and drug labs in Higueras de Abuya, a village about 75km (45 miles) south of the state capital, Culiacán. A spokesman for the army said the seizure of such a large amount of the synthetic drug - which in some forms is known by its street name crystal meth - would constitute a hard blow to whichever criminal gang was behind the labs. Mexico's security minister has deployed thousands of troops to the northern state of Sinaloa an effort to reign in the drug cartels that are active there. The seizure of the powerful and highly addictive stimulant comes just two weeks after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince US President Donald Trump to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month. One of the reasons Trump had cited for imposing the tariffs was the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US. He also accused the Mexican government of having ""an intolerable alliance"" with drug trafficking organisations. While the deployment of some extra troops to Sinaloa predates the spat between the US and Mexico over tariffs, the seizure of the methamphetamine stash will be welcome news to the Mexican government, which wants to demonstrate to the US that it is playing its part in trying to combat drug cartels.

,,,reliable,,"It is not cricket or politics that triggers the most ardent debate in Antigua and Barbuda. It is the ingredients of a beloved national dish. The question of whether ""ducana"" – a sweet potato and coconut dumpling – should or should not contain raisins has divided local residents for decades. The piquant pudding is one of many foods widely eaten in the Caribbean country that has its origins in Africa and has survived to this day. And its inclusion in a national inventory of cultural heritage currently being created looks set to reignite the jocular dispute. Antigua and Barbuda's traditional food is just one aspect of the work under way to preserve the twin isles' distinct features for posterity. The inventory will also include its unique dialect, bush medicine, games, crafts, architecture and boat-building techniques. The mammoth venture, being funded by the United Nations cultural body, Unesco, follows concerns that key elements of the country's cultural identity are being lost, explains project leader Dr Hazra Medica. ""There is no longer the traditional transmission of knowledge from older to younger people,"" she tells the BBC. ""Without that, we start to lose the sense of who we are. Outside influences can dilute indigenous culture and people fear that what is peculiarly Antiguan will be lost."" More than two dozen specially trained data collectors have been tasked with interviewing residents from each parish, gathering stories, photos and information. The results will be meticulously entered into a publicly accessible database. Local author Joy Lawrence needed little encouragement to take part. The former schoolteacher's books focus heavily on the country's Creole/English dialect that weaves in many African words from Antiguans' ancestors. English may be the main language but patois, spoken at accelerated speed, is ubiquitous and routinely used to show kinship and camaraderie. ""When the British brought Africans here, they could not speak English and the British could not speak African languages. Because the Africans came from all over and spoke different languages, they could not even converse among themselves for the most part,"" Ms Lawrence says. ""To communicate, the Africans borrowed some vocabulary from the British and incorporated their own pronunciation and syntax to form a pidgin thing. Over the generations, it became perfected and developed structure and grammar."" A couple of generations ago, Antiguan dialect was sneered at and children were commonly forbidden to speak it in school. There are still some who look down their nose at it today, Ms Lawrence scoffs. ""Our forebears worked hard to coin that language,"" she asserts. ""It's our first language; how can we not preserve what's ours? It's not a written language and we spell it any old how, but it has rhythm and I'm proud of it."" The dialect is characterised by an ""economy of words"" and sparse pronouns, she continues. ""We don't waste time to say 'not at all'; we just say 'tarl'. Instead of 'come here', we say 'cumyah'. And we never say her or him; it's always she or he."" In places such as school and church, dialect is used for ""emphasis, clarity and reinforcement"". ""Because we think in it,"" Ms Lawrence adds. Disagreements over the ""correct"" way of doing something is one reason for the decline of some cultural practices, Dr Medica believes. Varying methods of stirring ""fungee"", a cornmeal paste which also hails from the mother continent, and precisely what to add to it is another subject of friendly bickering. ""There's this idea that this is how it's done and should always be done. Sometimes younger people are turned off by not doing it 'right'. ""In the workshops, we saw the 'fungee war'. Antiguans say it should have okra in it, while Barbudans add peas, which made some gasp in shock,"" Dr Medica smiles. Novella Payne – who produces a range of teas, sauces and seasonings under her ""Granma Aki"" brand – learnt everything she knows from her mother and grandmother, but adds her ""own twist"" to time-honoured recipes. ""The seasoning is what sets Antiguan food apart – garlic, onion, thyme and seasoning peppers,"" she explains. Many of Ms Payne's creations feature local medicinal plants, long used to treat everything from coughs and fever to rashes and nausea. Soursop, lemongrass, noni and moringa regularly appear in her syrups and juices. ""Our food is delicious, nutritious and should be preserved because it's part of our culture and heritage,"" she adds. The project recently got under way in Antigua's sister isle, Barbuda, where Dwight Benjamin is striving to keep the art of traditional broom-making alive.

,,,reliable,,"The first thing kayaker Adrián Simancas noticed after he was eaten by a whale was the slime. ""I spent a second realising I was inside the mouth of something, that maybe it had eaten me, that it could have been an orca or a sea monster,"" the 23-year-old told BBC Mundo. Adrián had started to think how he might survive inside the humpback whale ""like Pinocchio"" - then the creature spat him back out. The Venezuelan kayaker had been paddling through the Strait of Magellan, off Chile's Patagonian coast, with his father when he felt something ""hit me from behind, closing in on me and sinking me"". His father, Dell, was able to capture the short-lived ordeal on video just metres away. ""I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, I realised I was inside the whale's mouth,"" Adrián told the BBC. ""I felt a slimy texture brush my face,"" he recalled, adding that all he could see was dark blue and white. ""I wondered what I could do if it had swallowed me since I could no longer fight to stop it,"" he said. ""I had to think about what to do next."" But within seconds, Adrián started to feel as though he was rising toward the surface. ""I was a little afraid of whether I would be able to hold my breath because I didn't know how deep I was, and I felt like it took me a long time to come up. ""I went up for two seconds, and finally I got to the surface and realised that it hadn't eaten me."" In a nearby kayak, Adrián's father Dell Simancas watched on in disbelief. The pair had just crossed Eagle Bay - down the coast from Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city - when he heard a crash behind him. ""When I turned around, I didn't see Adrián."" ""I was worried for a second, until I saw him coming up out of the sea,"" the 49-year-old said. ""Then I saw something, a body, which I immediately interpreted as most likely being a whale because of its size."" Dell had fixed a camera to the back of his kayak to record the rising waves - which captured his son's remarkable experience. Watching the footage back, Adrián - who moved with his father to Chile from Venezuela seven years ago in search of a better quality of life - was shocked to see just how enormous the whale had been. ""I hadn't seen the moment when the back appears, and the fin is visible. I didn't see it, I heard it. That made me nervous,"" he said. ""But later, with the video, I realised that it actually appeared before me in such a huge size that perhaps if I had seen it, it would have scared me even more."" For Adrián, the experience was not just about survival - but he said felt he had received a ""second chance"" when the whale spat him out. The ""unique"" experience in one of the most extreme places on Earth had ""invited me to reflect on what I could have done better up until that point, and on the ways I can take advantage of the experience and appreciate it as well"", he added. But there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert. Humpback whales have narrow throats ""about the size of a household pipe"" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC. ""They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna,"" he said. ""Ultimately, the whale spit out the kayak because it was physically impossible to swallow."" The humpback whale likely engulfed Adrián by accident, Mr Seba suggested. ""The whale was likely feeding on a school of fish when it unintentionally scooped up the kayak along with its meal. ""When whales surface too quickly while feeding, they can accidentally hit or engulf objects in their path."" He warned that the encounter served as ""an important reminder"" to avoid using paddleboards, surfboards or other silent vessels in areas where whales usually swim. Boats used for whale watching and research must always keep their engines on, he added, as the noise helps whales detect their presence.

,,,reliable,,"A Brazilian woman suspected of poisoning her husband's family with an arsenic-laced Christmas cake has been found dead in her prison cell in what police think was most likely a suicide. Deise Moura dos Anjos, 42, had been in pre-trial detention since January after prosecutors accused her of the murder on Christmas Eve of three relatives and the attempted murder of another three. The victims had all eaten from the cake, which forensic experts found had been baked with flour contaminated with the deadly poison. Police were also investigating if she may have killed her father-in-law, who died in September. Forensic experts who exhumed his body found high levels of arsenic, which led them to believe that he, too, had been poisoned. Moura dos Anjos denied any wrongdoing but local police chief Cléber dos Santos Lima told reporters last month that he was ""certain that she researched, bought (...) and used the poison to kill her victims"". He added that police had found evidence showing that she had bought arsenic on four separate occasions. Investigators tested many food items in the home of Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, where the six victims were taken ill, in order to find the source of the poisoning. Eventually, they found sky-high levels or arsenic in the flour - some of which Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, Zeli dos Anjos, had used to bake the Christmas cake. As Zeli dos Anjos had herself eaten from the cake and was taken seriously ill, police quickly ruled her out as a suspect even though she had prepared the cake.

Officials say the earthquake's epicentre was about 20 miles (32.1km) north of Honduras and 130 miles (209.2km) south-west of the Cayman Islands when it struck on Saturday evening local time. The US Tsunami Warning System had initially issued warnings to more than a dozen of countries - including waves of up to three metres (10ft). But, it later said the threat had passed. Advisories were also issued by the Tsunami Warning System for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following the earthquake - which were both also later cancelled. The Cayman Islands government had warned residents of coastal areas to move inland in a message on its website. It is unclear if there has been any movement or damage on land. The quake was the biggest to hit the region since 2021, when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About three hours after the earthquake, US authorities warned that ""minor sea level fluctuations"" of up to 30cm (11.8 inches) could still occur, but that any serious threat had passed. The USGS said large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected. In 2018 a 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred nearby, causing some damage and a small tsunami, it said.

,,,reliable,,"""If the island sinks, I will sink with it,"" Delfino Davies says, his smile not fading for a second. There is silence, except for the swish of his broom across the floor of the small museum he runs documenting the life of his community in Panama, the Guna. ""Before, you could hear children shouting… music everywhere, neighbours arguing,"" he says, ""but now all the sounds have gone"". His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change. The government has said they face ""imminent risk"" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050. In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland. The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community. ""My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,"" says Delfino. ""Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says. House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave. He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. ""The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,"" he adds. The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups. They are known for their clothes called ""molas"", decorated with colourful designs. The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is ""almost a certainty"" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century. As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms. Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century. On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep. Mr Paton says, ""it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise"".

,,,reliable,,"Gang rule in Haiti has led to a staggering rise in sexual violence against children, the United Nations' children's organisation has warned. The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said. Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies ""into battlegrounds"", spokesman James Elder said. Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence. Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped. She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti. She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil. The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections. Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said. The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight. The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school. Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence. But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that.

The State Department said in a statement on X that its government vessels ""can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year"". Responding to the comments, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) said it was ""empowered to set tolls and other fees for transiting the canal,"" adding that it had ""not made any adjustments to them"". US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to retake control of the waterway, which is key to global trade. The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been on a visit to Latin American countries this week, demanded that Panama make ""immediate changes"" to what he calls the ""influence and control"" of China over the canal. America's top diplomat said Panama had to act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries. During a visit to the country, Rubio met Panama's President José Raúl Mulino, as well as the canal's administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales. The ACP said after his visit that it had conveyed its intention to work with the US navy to optimise transit priority for its vessels through the canal. This commitment for dialogue with Washington remained, it said in a separate statement on Wednesday. US vessels make up a significant proportion of traffic in the canal. In 2024, 52% of transits through the waterway had ports of origin or destination in the United States, according to the canal's authorities. Up to 14,000 ships use the canal each year to avoid a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America. In his inaugural speech, President Trump said he planned to ""take back"" the canal, alleging that China was operating it and Panama had ""broken"" a promise to remain neutral. The plan was strongly rejected by Mulino, who said the key trade route ""is and will remain"" in the country's hands. He also rejected Trump's allegations about China's influence, saying there is ""no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration"". Trump recently reiterated his claim. Despite saying earlier this week he was ""not happy"" with the situation, he acknowledged that Panama had ""agreed to certain things"". Mulino has said his country will not continue its membership in China's infrastructure-building programme, the Belt and Road Initiative.

,,,reliable,,"The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO). A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by ""deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic"". The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body. The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the ""greatest political comeback in history"", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as ""my favourite president"". The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States. Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body. The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself. The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (£760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions. Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference. The bigger question is whether other leaders who share President Trump's world view, as President Milei clearly does, decide to take similar action. If more states pull out – and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit. Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO. Speaking at a news conference, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said that ""we Argentines are not going to allow an international body to interfere with our sovereignty, and even less with our health"". The spokesman argued that an exit from the WHO would provide Argentina with more flexibility to implement policies tailored to its own interests and to administer its funds as it saw fit. President Milei, who describes himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", has been critical of the WHO for some time but the idea of leaving the body appears to have gained traction in the days after Donald Trump signed an executive order setting in motion the US's exit from the international body. The two heads of state appear to share mutual admiration for each other. Javier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election victory on 5 November. Speaking at a gala at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the night of their meeting, Milei said that ""the winds of freedom [were] blowing much stronger since Trump's victory"". Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether President Milei was planning to withdraw from other international bodies or treaties, the presidential spokesman refused to rule out anything. ""The president is very determined when it comes to making Argentina freer, so any link that Argentina has with bodies that go against its freedoms, we're going to do our utmost to prevent them from interfering in the lives of Argentines.""

,,,reliable,,"More than 32,000 people have fled the northern Colombian region of Catatumbo where two rival rebel groups are engaged in a bloody battle. At least 80 people have been killed over recent days amid the surge in fighting between rebels from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). One official government agency said it had received reports of ELN rebels going house-to-house and killing those suspected of ties with rival groups. The government has declared a state of emergency and the first of a planned deployment of 5,000 soldiers have arrived in the area. President Gustavo Petro said on Tuesday that the state ""had failed"" to contain the violence but that it would learn from that failure. His government has reactivated arrest warrants for 31 top commanders of the ELN, which had been suspended while the rebel group held peace talks with the government. Last week, President Petro suspended the talks for a second time in less than a year due to the violence in Catatumbo. The fighting has been so fierce that 32,000 people have fled their homes, according to figures provided by the Ombudsman's office on Tuesday. Many have sought refuge in schools and sports stadiums which have been converted into impromptu shelters. Investigative news programme Noticias Uno said it had seen a military intelligence report which suggested that the surge in violence between the two rival groups had been triggered by ""the loss of a multi-million-dollar cocaine shipment in November 2024"". According to the report, a member of the Farc dissident group known as Frente 33 came to an agreement with their rivals from the ELN to ""not interfere"" with each other's cocaine production and shipments. Both the ELN and the remnants of the Farc rebel group which remained active after the main guerrilla group signed a peace agreement in 2016 are heavily involved in the drugs trade. The pact between the two groups seems to have broken down over the ""lost"" cocaine shipment, the intelligence report suggests. Although it is not clear which ""lost"" stash the report is referring to, Colombian media have pointed out that in December last year counter-narcotics agents in the Dominican Republic seized 9.5 tonnes of cocaine which they said had originated in Catatumbo. The mountainous region, on Colombia's north-eastern border with Venezuela, is a hotspot for cocaine production and trafficking. President Petro, who was a member of a left-wing rebel group in his youth, said this week that ""what happened in Catatumbo is yet another example of a shift from insurgent guerrillas to narco-armed organisations"". He also referred to the ELN as a ""mafia"". Petro campaigned on a promise to bring ""total peace"" to Colombia but last week he said that ""the ELN has no will for peace"".",,,,"Rebel feud displaces more than 30,000 in northern Colombia","Vanessa Buschschlüter and Ana Hanssen, BBC News & BBC Monitoring, Miami",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"The death toll from attacks by a rebel group in Colombia's Catatumbo region has risen to 60, the country's human rights office has said. Rival factions have been vying for control of the cocaine trade in the region - which sits near the border with Venezuela - for years. The Ombudsman's Office said the latest violence involved the National Liberation Army (ELN) - the largest armed group still active in Colombia - and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which signed a peace treaty with the state in 2016. The attacks broke an uneasy truce between the guerrilla groups, which had been in peace negotiations with the government. The Ombudsman's Office, a government agency that oversees the protection of citizens' human and civil rights, previously reported that 40 had died in the violence. It said that many people, including community leaders and their families, were facing a ""special risk"" of being kidnapped or killed at the hands of the ELN. It noted that 20 people had recently been kidnapped, half of whom were women. The office said that among those killed were seven peace treaty signatories and Carmelo Guerrero, the leader of the Association for Peasant Unity in Catatumbo (Asuncat), a local advocacy group. Asuncat wrote on social media on Friday that Roger Quintero and Freiman Velasquez, members of its board of directors, had not been seen since the previous day, and that it suspected armed groups had taken them. ""In some communities in the region, food shortages are beginning to be reported, affecting local communities,"" the Ombudsman's Office wrote in a statement on Saturday, adding that thousands of people are believed to have been displaced by the violence. ""Elderly people, children, adolescents, pregnant women and people with disabilities are suffering the consequences of these events."" ""Catatumbo is once again stained with blood,"" the Association of Mothers of Catatumbo for Peace wrote on Friday. ""The bullets exchanged not only hurt those who hold the weapons, but also tear apart the dreams of our communities, break up families and sow terror in the hears of our children."" The Ombudsman's Office appeared to lay the blame for the latest violence on the ELN, which had been in peace talks with the Colombian government until they were suspended on Friday due to the violence in Catatumbo. President Gustavo Petro - who since his election in 2022 has sought to end violence between armed groups in the country - accused the ELN of ""war crimes"" and said the group ""shows no willingness to make peace"". The ELN accused Farc of having initiated the conflict by killing civilians in a statement on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. Farc has not publicly responded to the allegation.

,,,reliable,,"A statue of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro has been reinstalled in the centre of Lima, the capital of Peru, more than 20 years after it had been removed. The sculpture was unveiled during a ceremony marking the 490th anniversary of the city's founding. Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 after defeating the Inca Empire and claiming their lands for the Spanish crown. Indigenous leaders say he was a mass murderer who destroyed their culture, while those who supported the statue's return said Peru should not erase its history. The monument, which shows Pizarro on horseback with his sword drawn, was created by the American sculptor Charles Rumsey and offered by his widow to commemorate the city's fourth centenary in 1935. In 2003, it was moved to a park next to train tracks outside the city centre following calls for its removal. Luis Bogdanovich, who was in charge of restoring the historic centre, told local media the statue had become damaged by the constant passing of trains, which caused it to crack. Rafael López Aliaga, Lima's mayor, and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, president of the Community of Madrid, presented the bronze statue on Saturday alongside Mr Bogdanovich and several descendants of Pizarro in Lima's main square, Plaza de Armas. Díaz Ayuso said the ceremony was commemorating ""not only the birth of a city, but also the beginning of a historic encounter that forever transformed the world"", the Spanish daily El Pais reported.

,,,reliable,,"A leading Cuban dissident and activist has been released from jail as part of a wider prisoner release deal between the Cuban government and the United States. Jose Daniel Ferrer spent more than three years in prison following anti-government protests that swept through the Communist-run island in 2021. Under the agreement brokered by the Catholic Church, outgoing US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism just days before the end of his term. In return, Cuba said it would free 553 people, many of whom were detained during the anti-government protests. The island began releasing the first of hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday, freeing about 20 people, according to local NGOs. Ferrer is one of the most recognised names among Cuban dissidents and pro-democracy activists. The 54-year-old leader of Cuba's Patriotic Union (Unpacu), an opposition group in the country, was jailed and charged with public disorder following the 2021 protests. ""I am at home, in fair health, but with the courage to continue fighting for the freedom of Cuba,"" Ferrer told Reuters in a phone conversation. Many of the prisoners released this week were arrested in association with 2021 protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices. Biden's move to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism came just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has been critical of the decision to ease sanctions on Cuba, hinting that it could be reversed.

One of those released was 53-year-old Donaida Pérez Paseiro, who had been sentenced to eight years in prison for taking part in the 2021 anti-government protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices. In a video she posted on social media, Ms Pérez Paseiro said that the Cuban government had used her and her fellow prisoners as ""a bargaining chip"" to leverage Cuba's removal from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. In the recording, she also said she would continue to ""fight for Cuba's freedom"". Dariel Cruz García was also among those who were freed on Wednesday. The 23-year-old had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition after joining in the 2021 protests. He told Reuters that officials had announced that he could serve the remainder of his sentence - which has been reduced since he was originally sentenced - at home.

,,,reliable,,"The number of people internally displaced by gang violence in Haiti has tripled to more than one million, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned on Tuesday. The situation is particularly dire in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where displacement has risen by 87% between 2023 and 2024, IOM figures show. Gangs control almost the entire city, leading to the collapse of the remaining health services and triggering food insecurity. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. IOM Spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi said many of the more than one million displaced people had had to flee multiple times as the gangs expanded their territory in Port-au-Prince. An estimated 85% of the capital is now estimated to be under gang control. Most of those displaced fled Port-au-Prince for rural areas, where resources are limited, the IOM warned. Its Director-General, Amy Pope, said that Haiti needed ""sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives"". Half of those displaced are children, according to the IOM's figures. The agency described how families were ""struggling to survive in makeshift shelters while facing mounting health and protection risks"". Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse. A UN-backed multinational security force arrived in Haiti in June to try and re-establish control but has so far made few inroads into gang-held territory. The international police force, which is meant to bolster the Haitian National Police force, is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs.

,,,reliable,,"""It all started as a small passion project,"" says Fabriccio Díaz, 28, who, together with his wife Lucía Ramírez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City. ""Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,"" he adds. Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6. Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film. ""When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,"" Lucía recalls. And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala. The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips. ""We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,"" says Fabriccio. Fabriccio and Lucía's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise ""photo walks"" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras. For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iván Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with. ""It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,"" he tells the BBC. Iván says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. ""They just don't understand our perspective,"" he explains. ""We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,"" he adds. Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven López from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography. The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him. ""Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!"", he tells the BBC. The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places. ""It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,"" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed. And there are other hurdles, too. Fabriccio and Lucía explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal. ""Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,"" says Fabriccio. Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Lucía are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place. Lucía explains how sometimes clients ""put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back"". ""It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,"" she adds. Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Lucía, the process is very much ""hands-on"". For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly. ""The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,"" recalls Fabriccio. ""But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,"" he adds. Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Lucía, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process. The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house. There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America. Fabriccio and Lucía have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls. The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2. ""It is my dream to revitalise the classical cinematography scene here in Central America! We have so much talent expertise and enthusiasm to offer the world. (...) with Arca Film Lab we have started a movement that we want to push further and further,"" says Fabriccio.

The inauguration ceremony was overshadowed by recrimination from the international community and Venezuelan opposition leaders. Rewards have also been offered for information leading to the arrest and or conviction of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. A new reward of up to $15m for Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino has also been offered. The UK also issued sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials, including judges, members of the security forces and military officials. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said those sanctioned were responsible for ""undermining democracy, the rule of law, and human rights violations"". Foreign Secretary David Lammy went on to describe Maduro's regime as ""fraudulent"". Also on Friday, the EU said it was extending ""restrictive measures"" against Venezuela because of ""the lack of progress... leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law"". The bloc also sanctioned a further 15 Venezuelan officials. Canada also imposed fresh sanctions in what Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly called Maduro's ""shameless actions"". Joly said Canada ""will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights"". Maduro and his government have repeatedly denounced many of the allegations made by Western countries and opposition leaders. The reward from the US cites narcotics and corruption charges dating back to 2020. In 2020, the US charged Maduro, and other senior officials in the country with ""narco-terrorism"". It accused them of flooding the US with cocaine and using drugs as a weapon to undermine the health of Americans. Maduro has rejected the accusations. The US also re-imposed oil sanctions last year, after temporarily easing them in the hope Maduro could be incentivised to hold free and fair elections. The Venezuelan president has blamed an economic collapse in his country on US-led sanctions he calls illegitimate and imperial. His critics blame corruption and economic mismanagement. On Friday, President Maduro took the oath of office, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a ""period of peace"". ""This new presidential term will be the period of peace, prosperity, equality, and the new democracy,"" he said. ""I swear by history, I swear by my life, and I will fulfil it,"" he added. The 28 July election results were widely rejected by the international community, including by Brazil and Colombia, some of Venezuela's left-wing neighbours. The inauguration itself was a tightly controlled affair. Most accredited Venezuelan media were not allowed inside and foreign journalists were not allowed in the country. Maduro has a few allies remaining including Iran, China and Russia but is increasingly isolated on the world stage. The Cuban and Nicaraguan presidents were the only leaders present at the inauguration. The 62-year-old was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised the exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect. González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support. The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention. On Friday, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the release of all who have been ""arbitrarily detained"" since the elections.

Maduro, 62, was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, reject the result as fraudulent, and recognise the now-exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect. González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support. The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention. Machado, whom González replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running herself, has also been targeted. She went into hiding soon after the disputed elections, and was last seen in public in August before Thursday's rally. Earlier in the day, the UN expressed its alarm after it received reports of arbitrary detentions and intimidation in Venezuela ahead of the opposition marches. It highlighted the arrest of Carlos Correa, the head of an NGO promoting press freedom, who was seized by unidentified hooded men earlier in the week. Maduro's government has deployed thousands of police officers in Caracas, where the government-allied National Assembly plans to swear Maduro in for a third term in office. The opposition for its part urged its supporters to turn out in droves in an effort to thwart the ceremony. In the city of Valencia, police fired tear gas at protesters, according to Reuters. In western Caracas, 70-year-old Niegalos Payares told the news agency that ""I'm not afraid, I lost my fear a long time ago"". And in the city of Maracay, in central Venezuela, Roisa Gómez told a Reuters reporter that she was ""fighting for my vote, which I cast for Edmundo González. They cannot steal the election."" Maduro was declared the winner of the presidential election by the government-dominated National Electoral Council (CNE) but the CNE has to this day failed to provide detailed voting data to back up this claim. Earlier this month in Washington, González met US President Joe Biden, who said that Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"". In Panama, González deposited thousands of voting tallies which the opposition collected in the country's bank for safekeeping. The tallies have been the key evidence offered by the opposition to show that González, not Maduro won the election.

,,,reliable,,"""They have already tortured me and repressed me, but they will not silence me. My voice is the only thing I have left."" This is how Juan, a young man aged around 20, begins his story. He alleges he was physically and psychologically tortured by Venezuelan security forces after being detained in connection with the presidential elections on 28 July. He was one of many hundreds of people arrested during protests after the electoral authorities - which are dominated by government loyalists - announced that the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro, had won. The National Electoral Council (CNE) did not make the voting tallies public and the Venezuelan opposition has described the official result as fraudulent, pointing out that the voting tallies it got hold of with the help of election observers suggest an overwhelming victory for its candidate, Edmundo González. Juan was released from prison in mid-November, days after Maduro called on judicial authorities to ""rectify"" any injustices in the arrests. The BBC spoke to him via video call. For his own safety, we have decided to withhold some of the details of his case and have changed his name. The young man alleges that many of the detainees are mistreated, given ""rotten food"" and that the most rebellious are locked up in ""torture chambers"". He showed the BBC documents and evidence that corroborate his story, which coincides with other testimony and with the complaints of non-governmental organisations. Juan, an anti-government political activist, says the election campaign and the days leading up to the election were ""marked by hope"" and many people were keen to vote for change. But the announcement of Maduro's victory shortly after midnight that Sunday turned what for many was a celebratory mood into confusion and anger. Thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to protest against a result they decried as fraudulent. The opposition and international organisations say what followed was police repression which caused the deaths of more than 20 protesters. Maduro and some of his officials in turn have blamed the opposition, the ""extreme right"" and ""terrorist"" groups for the deaths. Gonzalo Himiob of Venezuelan non-governmental organisation Foro Penal says people were arrested for as little as ""celebrating the opposition's declaration of Edmundo González as the winner, or for posting something on social media"". ""We also have cases of people who were not even protesting, but for some reason they were near a protest and they were arrested,"" he added. Juan says that is what happened to him. The young political activist says he had been running an errand when a group of hooded men intercepted him, covered his face and beat him, accusing him of being a terrorist. ""They planted Molotov cocktails and petrol on me, and then took me to a detention centre,"" he continued. He was held in a prison in the interior of Venezuela for several weeks until he was transferred to Tocorón, a notorious high-security prison about 140km south-west of the capital, Caracas. There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life. ""When we arrived at Tocorón, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor,"" Juan recounts. Juan was assigned a small cell measuring three metres by three metres, which he had to share with five other people. There were six beds arranged in three bunk beds, and in one corner there was a septic tank and ""a pipe that served as a shower"". That was the bathroom. ""In Tocorón I felt more like I was in a concentration camp than in a prison,"" says the young man. He describes the beds as ""concrete tombs"" with a very thin mattress. ""They tortured us physically and psychologically.

,,,reliable,,"Lying at the crossroads of the North and South American continents and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Panama is of immense strategic importance. This has made it the frequent object of US attention. The United States supported its secession from Colombia in 1903, and secured a sovereign zone in which to build the Panama Canal - which remained under US control from 1914 until 1999. The US invaded in 1989 to depose a former ally, military ruler Manuel Noriega, over his repressive rule and use of the country as a centre for drug trafficking. Panama has the largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside the Amazon Basin. However, it is for a feat of engineering, the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, that Panama is famous. Every year some 15,000 vessels use the Panama Canal - about 5% of global maritime trade and 40% of US container traffic. However, recently the canal has been hit by drought, as the canal region is receiving less rainfall than normal. It has introduced water-saving measures, meaning fewer ships can pass through each day.

,,,reliable,,"US President Joe Biden has called the exiled candidate for Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, ""the true winner"" of the country's presidential election last July after meeting him at the White House. In a social media post, Biden said Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"". González fled to Spain in September after turmoil following Venezuela's election, in which incumbent President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory - something disputed by González and many sections of the international community. The Maduro government reacted to the meeting with fury, calling it ""grotesque"" and accusing Biden of backing a violent anti-democratic project, Reuters news agency reports. Tension has been rising in the country as the day of the presidential inauguration - set for Friday - approaches, with both Maduro and González telling their supporters that they will be sworn in. The Maduro government, which has been in power since 2013, has deployed thousands of police and cut off major roads leading into the capital, Caracas, in what is widely seen as a tactic to deter any anti-government protests. But González, who has been living in exile in Spain since September, says he will defy an arrest warrant which has been issued for him and return to his homeland to take up office. However, he has not given any details as to how he plans to enter Venezuela, where the government is offering a $100,000 (£80,000) reward for information leading to his arrest. González has also not said how he plans to be sworn in when the National Assembly - the legislative body where the presidential oath is performed - is firmly in the hands of government loyalists. The opposition has nevertheless remained defiant and called on its supporters to take to the streets on Thursday. It has also rallied key international support with González's visit to the White House - the latest stop in a tour which has also seen him meet with the Argentine and Uruguayan presidents. In all three countries, he was met by cheering crowds of Venezuelans who held up signs reading ""freedom"". Almost eight million Venezuelans have left their homeland in recent years to escape economic hardship and political persecution, and many of them are living in Latin America and the US. Following Biden's meeting with González on Monday, the White House said it would be ""closely"" following the response Venezuela's authority will give to the opposition protests planned for Thursday. In the aftermath of July's election, thousands of Venezuelans who had expressed their anger at Maduro's claim of election victory were arrested and charged with ""terrorism"". Many remain behind bars. Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running in the election and who threw her weight behind Edmundo González, told AFP news agency on Monday that all the Maduro government had left was fear. ""If we all come out, millions, how can a few hundred or a few thousand armed people [prevail] against 30 million Venezuelans?"" she asked. Referring to the voting tallies that the opposition has made public, she also insisted that the ""whole world knows"" González is ""the rightful president-elect"". The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election. The government-aligned National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner on 29 July, the day after the vote, but it has to this day failed to provide the tallies to back up its claim. With the help of accredited election witnesses, the opposition managed to collect and publish more than 80% of the voting tallies. Independent observers and media, including US outlets the New York Times and CNN, have reviewed the tallies and say they suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes, compared to Maduro's 30%. In December, the UN Human Rights Committee ordered Venezuela ""to refrain from destroying"" the voting tallies.",,,,Biden meets exiled Venezuelan opposition candidate,"Vanessa Buschschlüter and Jack Burgess, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A contingent of 150 Guatemalan soldiers has arrived in Haiti, tasked with helping to restore order amid the chaos wrought by armed gangs. A first group of 75 soldiers arrived on Friday and another 75 on Saturday, all drafted from the military police, according to Guatemala's government. A state of emergency has been in place across the Caribbean nation for months as the government battles violent gangs that have taken control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. The forces are in Haiti to boost a United Nations-backed security mission led by Kenya that has so far failed to prevent violence from escalating. Kenya sent nearly 400 police officers in June and July last year to help combat the gangs. This was the first tranche of a UN-approved international force that will be made up of 2,500 officers from various countries. A small number of forces from Jamaica, Belize and El Salvador are also in Haiti as part of the mission and the US is the operation's largest funder. In March 2024, armed gangs stormed Haiti's two biggest prisons, freeing around 3,700 inmates. The Ouest Department - a region including Port-au-Prince - was originally put under a state of emergency on 3 March, after escalating violence gripped the capital. Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti the poorest nation in the Americas. In 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince.

Footage of one of Janaína Lima's employees hauling away the facilities was posted online as her tenure as Sao Paulo councilwoman ended. ""I decided to donate the equipment I acquired with my own resources to the chamber,"" she said in statement on X, following a social media backlash. ""Obviously, neither I nor my advisers need a toilet."" CCTV cameras caught employees in her office removing the facilities that were installed when she took office eight years ago. In a statement posted on social media, Lima said the bathroom renovation was paid for with her own money and therefore not an asset belonging to the council. Lima said she had followed the guidance of the legal department, that had indicated that all personally installed resources should be removed. She told Brazilian media outlet G1 the hydraulics in the building are ""sensitive"". The 41-year-old added that other fixtures she had bought for the office - such as a glass partition and industrial-style light fittings - would remain in place for her successor. Lima served as a councillor for the New Party until 1 January. Adrilles Jorge, of the Brazilian Labour Party, took over Lima's old office after the 2024 elections.

,,,reliable,,"Five people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction singer Liam Payne in Argentina, the authorities there say. The 31-year-old star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires. The hotel's manager, Gilda Martin, and its receptionist, Esteban Grassi, as well as Payne's friend Roger Nores have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's prosecutor's office says. Ezequiel Pereyra - who also worked at the hotel - and Braian Paiz, a waiter, have been charged with supplying drugs. Under Argentina's legal system, the prosecutor's office gathers evidence which it then presents to a judge, who has to decide whether to proceed to trial. According to a statement released by the prosecutor's office, Judge Laura Bruniard already took the decision to proceed to the next stage on Friday. The defendants' lawyers can appeal against that decision. If their appeals are not successful, the trial phase starts. In court documents, Judge Bruniard listed the charges against the five suspects, who are referred to by their initials, as is the custom in court documents at this stage of the proceedings. Judge Bruniard said that she did not think that Liam Payne's friend, the hotel manager and the receptionist ""had planned or wanted the death of Payne"" but that their actions had created a ""risk"" to his life. If found guilty, the three could face sentences of between one and five years in prison. The sentence for supplying drugs is more severe and ranges between four and 15 years in jail. Judge Bruniard has ordered the two accused of supplying the drugs be remanded in custody. They have been summoned to appear within 24 working hours. Fernando Madeo Facente, the lawyer representing Braian Paiz, told the BBC that he had advised his client not to hand himself in. He said that Braian Paiz posed no flight risk and had in no way hindered the investigation. To the contrary, he had handed over his mobile phone containing chats with Liam Payne to the authorities willingly. The lawyer argued that holding Braian Paiz in pre-trial detention would therefore be completely unnecessary and over the top. He also argued that the prosecution had gone too far when it had accused his client of selling drugs to Payne. Mr Madeo Facente said that his client and Payne had spent time together ""during which they talked and did a lot of things, in private"". ""And one of those things they did was to consume drugs,"" the lawyer said. But he insisted that no money had been exchanged and that allegations to the contrary were ""completely false"" and lacking in evidence. He also emphatically rejected articles in the Argentine media which had described his client as ""Liam Payne's dealer"". In November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in Payne's body. A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as ""multiple trauma"" and ""internal and external haemorrhage"", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony. According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. The prosecutor's office said this ruled out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they had concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions. Speaking to US celebrity news outlet TMZ after Payne's death, Roger Nores said he was a ""very good friend"" of the singer and they had spent time together on the day the star died. He said Payne ""seemed playful and happy"" when he left him about an hour before the musician fell from the balcony. After Payne's death, police found substances in his hotel room and objects and furniture that had been damaged. Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken ""too many drugs and alcohol"", and was ""trashing the entire room"", it was previously reported. Payne became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016. The singer's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, last month. His former bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik were among the mourners, alongside Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy and his former partner Cheryl, with whom he shares a son.",,,,Five charged in connection with Liam Payne's death,"David Mercer and Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Trinidad and Tobago has declared a state of emergency as gang violence in the Caribbean nation continues to escalate. President Christine Carla Kangaloo issued the declaration on the advice of Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who had been under growing pressure to take action over worsening crime figures. The twin-island republic has one of the highest homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a record murder tally of more than 620 this year so far in a population of 1.5 million people. Organised crime is responsible for the majority of the murders, many of them linked to the international drug trade. According to the US state department, the country's close proximity to Venezuela, porous borders and direct transportation routes to Europe and North America make it ""a prime location for narcotics trans-shipment"". In the latest violent incident, five men were shot dead in a shop in the poverty-stricken Laventille area on Sunday. Police believe the killings were in reprisal for the murder of a prominent gang member the previous day. Under the state of emergency, police will have the authority to arrest people on suspicion of involvement in crimes. They will also have the power to ""search and enter both public and private premises as necessary"". The prime minister's office issued a statement saying the intention was to ""address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms"". However, it added that there were no plans to impose a curfew. It is unclear how the state of emergency will affect Trinidad's world-renowned Carnival, which is set to culminate in a massive street parade on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in early March.

,,,reliable,,"Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media. The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake - both of whom are still in hospital. Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon. Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house. They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional. Test results from the cake are expected to be available by next week, according to local media. On Friday, police requested for the body of a man - the late husband of the woman who made the cake - to be exhumed. He died in September from food poisoning, but police said his death was deemed natural at the time. She is not considered a suspect in either of these cases at this time, and investigations are ongoing. Six out of seven people at the Christmas celebration ate the cake on Monday afternoon, including the woman who baked it. Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic.

,,,reliable,,"Two-year-old Shaina is hooked up to an intravenous drip at one of the few functioning hospitals in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Her mother, Venda, desperately hopes it will alleviate the acute malnutrition the emaciated young girl is suffering from. Shaina is one of 760,000 children who are on the brink of famine in Haiti. Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter. Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina. ""I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her,"" she says tearfully. Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control. Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse. The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients. The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds. Pierre is one of them. He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone. ""I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs,"" he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital. To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023. Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order. On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear. Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up. Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access. The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire. Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls. After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on. But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street. One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning. The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted. Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country. The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise. Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission. The mission commander says there is ""overwhelming support"" for the MSS in Haiti. ""The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,"" he says. The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces. It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire. The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low. The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000. And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police. In one such area, Wharf Jérémie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December. In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks. And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year. One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina. As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince. Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians. Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list. Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members ""love our country a lot"" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men ""do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us"".",,,,On patrol with Kenyan forces inside Haiti's gang warzone,"Nawal Al-Maghafi and Jasmin Dyer, BBC World Service, Reporting fromPort-au-Prince, Haiti",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Authorities in Guatemala have resisted efforts by members of a Jewish sect to recapture 160 children rescued from its premises. The children were taken into care on Friday when police raided a farm used by the Lev Tahor movement, which is under investigation in several countries for serious sexual offences. Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said they were allegedly being abused by a member of the sect. But on Sunday, sect members broke into a care centre where they were being held in an attempt to get them back, leading to scuffles with police. The Lev Tahor sect is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers. It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes. The sect accuses the Guatemalan authorities of religious persecution. The community settled in Mexico and Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. In 2022, members of the sect were arrested in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, but they were later freed for lack of evidence. The events began when police raided the sect's farm in Oratorio, south-east of Guatemala City, on Friday, taking the children into care. Prosecutors said there were suspicions of ""forced pregnancy, mistreatment of minors and rape"". But two days later, about 100 of the children's relatives - all members of the sect - gathered outside the centre where they were being held to call for their return. Some sect members then forced open the gate and tried to abduct the children and adolescents sheltered there, the Attorney General's Office said. But the children were intercepted by the authorities and put into a white minibus, local media reported. With police help, the centre ""managed to locate and protect everyone again"", the Attorney General's Office added. Officials had previously tried to check on the children's wellbeing, but were prevented from entering the farm by sect members. Authorities estimate that the community is made up of about 50 families residing in Guatemala, the US, Canada and other countries.

The gang selling these branded drugs is the Pure Third Command, one of Rio's most powerful criminal groups, with a reputation both for making its opponents disappear, and for fanatical evangelical Christianity. They took control of a group of five favelas in the north of the city – now known as the Israel Complex – after one of their leaders had what he believed was a revelation from God, says theologian Vivian Costa, author of the book, Evangelical Drug Dealers. She says the gangsters see themselves as ""soldiers of crime"", with Jesus as ""the owner"" of the territory they dominate. Controversially, some have dubbed them ""Narco-Pentecostals"". One man who has experience of crime and religion – though in his case, not at the same time – is Pastor Diego Nascimento, who became a Christian after hearing the gospel from a gangster holding a gun. Looking at him, it's hard to believe that this boyish looking 42-year-old Wesleyan Methodist minister with a ready smile and dimples, was once a member of Rio's notorious Red Command crime gang and managed its activities in the city's Vila Kennedy favela. Four years in prison for drug dealing weren't enough to make him give up crime. But when he became addicted to crack cocaine his standing in the gang plummeted. ""I lost my family. I practically lived on the street for almost a year. I went so far as to sell things from my house to buy crack,"" he says. It was at that point, when he was at rock bottom, that a well-known drug dealer in the favela summoned him. ""He started preaching to me, saying there was a way out, that there was a solution for me, which was to accept Jesus,"" he recalls. The young addict took this advice and began his journey to the pulpit. Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself. Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms. ""I don't see them as evangelical believers,"" he says. ""I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives. ""There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer."" Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade. As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power. One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths. Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living ""under siege"" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion. ""In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory."" Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as ""Jesus is the Lord of this place."" Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them. But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact. ""These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates."" She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela. While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has ""increased dramatically"" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall. Jagun, who is a babalorixá (high priest) of the Candomblé religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities. ""This is a form of neo-Crusade,"" he says. ""The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God."" But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints. ""If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] Ògún, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings. ""That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'.""",,,,The drug-trafficking Rio gangsters who see themselves as God's 'soldiers of crime',"Lebo Diseko, Global Religion Correspondent & Julia Carneiro",,,,,,,1

They were found in an expedition to Alto Mayo - which includes the Amazon rainforest - by scientists from the non-profit organisation Conservation International and members of local indigenous groups. Up to 48 other new species may also have been found, although further study will be needed to determine whether they are new, Conservation International says. ""Discovering so many new species of mammals and vertebrates is really incredible, especially in such a human-influenced landscape,"" said Trond Larsen, senior director at Conservation International. Alto Mayo is a protected area in northern Peru with multiple ecosystems and Indigenous territories. It has a relatively high population density, putting pressure on environmentalism through deforestation and agricultural expansion, Conservation International said. Yulisa Tuwi, an Awajún woman who assisted with the research, said the report ""allows the Awajún to protect our culture, natural resources and our territory"", as it gives them a better understanding of the ecosystems. ""[The Awajún] have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,"" Mr Larsen said. The expedition also found a new species of dwarf squirrel, eight types of fish, three amphibians and 10 types of butterfly. This ""blob-headed"" fish is a new discovery to science, but the Indigenous Awajún people who helped with the expedition were already aware of its existence. The fish scientists were particularly shocked by its enlarged head - something they had never seen before. This dwarf squirrel measures just 14cm (5.5in), half the length of an average grey squirrel in the UK, which ranges from 24 to 29cm, according to the UK Squirrel Accord. ""[It] fits so easily in the palm of your hand. Adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast,"" Larsen said. ""It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.""

,,,reliable,,"A forensic expert, three police officers and a music impresario have been jailed for covering up the 2015 murder of Venezuelan rapper Canserbero. Canserbero, who had been named best Spanish-language rapper by Rolling Stone magazine, was drugged and stabbed to death by his manager, Natalia Améstica. Améstica and her brother then threw his body from a 10th floor window. The five people sentenced on Tuesday have been found guilty of helping the siblings stage the crime scene so Canserbero's murder appeared a suicide. They have been given jail terms ranging between 15 and 20 years. Natalia Améstica and her brother Guillermo were already sentenced to 25 years in prison back in February for murder. The death on 19 January 2015 of Canserbero, whose real name was Tirone González, shocked the Venezuelan rap scene. It was ruled at the time that the 26-year-old star had killed his friend Carlos Molnar in a knife fight before jumping from a window. But in December 2023, Natalia Améstica confessed to stabbing both Molnar and Canserbero. In a video statement released by the Venezuelan attorney general last year she recounted what had happened on the night. Natalia Améstica claims that she was angry with the rapper after she had learned that Canserbero no longer wanted her as his manager. She described how Canserbero came to her apartment in the Venezuelan city of Maracay on 19 January 2015. He was accompanied by his friend Carlos Molnar, who was also Natalia Améstica's long-term boyfriend. ""The chance arose to make them a tea,"" she explained in the video, adding that she spiked their beverage with a powerful tranquiliser. When her drugged partner Carlos Molnar entered the kitchen, she stabbed him in the neck, in the back and in the arm. Canserbero witnessed Améstica's attack on her boyfriend but, under the influence of the drugs Améstica had slipped him, he collapsed on the sofa. Améstica then proceeded to stab him twice. ""In desperation, I then called my brother Guillermo to help me resolve the situation,"" she said in the video confession. Her brother arrived with the three officers from Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin, who have now been sentenced. ""They finished arranging the scene in a way to make it look like a murder-suicide,"" according to Natalia Améstica. She said that the officers ""stabbed Carlos [Molnar] a few more times, my brother Guillermo stabbed him four times. The rest, the Sebin officials did"". ""Then we were told how to throw him out of the window to complete the murder-suicide scene,"" she said in her confession. Her brother Guillermo said that a forensic detective who arrived at the scene became suspicious, remarking that it appeared ""manipulated"". According to Guillermo Améstica, the forensic expert asked for a bribe of $10,000 (£7,880) in exchange for helping the siblings cover up the crime and to make it look like Canserbero had attacked Molnar before jumping out of the window. The fifth man sentenced on Tuesday is Marcos Pratolongo, a music impresario who provided security at some of Canserbero's concerts. At the time of his arrest, Venezuela's attorney general had said that Pratolongo was in possession of the keys to Canserbero's apartment, from which important evidence had disappeared. The attorney general posted on social media on Tuesday that Pratolongo had been found guilty of complicity in Canserbero's murder but did not provide further details of his role in the crime.",,,,Five jailed for covering up murder of rapper Canserbero,"Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The founder of the feared Los Zetas drugs cartel has been deported to Mexico after serving a lengthy jail sentence in the United States. Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, 57, led Los Zetas until 2003, when he was cornered by Mexican soldiers near his hometown of Matamoros. Under his leadership, the group became one of the most powerful and brutal hit squads in the Mexican drug wars. US immigration officials handed Cárdenas over to Mexican police at the Otay border crossing, where he was quickly re-arrested and taken to El Altiplano maximum security jail in Mexico state. Mexican prosecutors said he had been arrested on charges of murder and organised crime dating back to his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico. Cárdenas Guillén made his criminal career in the Gulf drugs cartel in the 1990s, reportedly not shying away from having his allies killed to rise to the top, a practice which earned him the nickname of ""Mata Amigos"" (Spanish for ""killer of friends""). But what he became infamous for was recruiting members of Mexico's elite special forces and using them as hitmen and enforcers for the Gulf cartel. The law enforcers-turned-contract killers became known as Los Zetas. The brutal methods they used, such as decapitating and dismembering their victims, quickly spread terror through the north-eastern part of Mexico which was their stronghold. By the early 2000s, Cárdenas Guillén was one of the most wanted men in Mexico. Mexican security forces managed to apprehend him in his home state of Tamaulipas in 2003 after a bloody gun battle. Aware of the power the gang leader wielded in the area, the security forces quickly flew him to the capital, Mexico City, were he was put into pre-trial detention. In 2007, he was extradited to the US. There, he was charged not just with trafficking tonnes of cocaine into the US but also with threatening to assault and murder federal agents. He pleaded guilty in 2010 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Having served a large part of his sentence, he was released in August of 2024 from federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This paved the way for his deportation to Mexico on Monday. Mexican prosecutors said there were seven federal cases still open against Cárdenas Guillén and that he could be sentenced to a total of more than 700 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.",,,,Los Zetas cartel boss re-arrested in Mexico after US jail time,"Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News",,,,,,,1

To thank, firstly, God, who has looked after me in a very generous manner,"" he said. Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache. Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced. The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement. ""Thank you very much for the prayers,"" Lula added on Sunday. ""And for those who only have hate, you're forgiven. I am here, alive, whole, and with more desire to work.""

,,,reliable,,"As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US. Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years. Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation. That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can ""make Argentina great again"". Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership. But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed? Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires. In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half. Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008. All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department. Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely. Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in Argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing. But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical. Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that ""taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"". ""The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US."" Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"". ""That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else."" Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"". But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants. ""I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the BBC. He points out that Trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government."" In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government. Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different. Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"". ""If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed. Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's. Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs. He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",,,,"Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?","Robert Plummer, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G? While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online. That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024. This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion. So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernabéu Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year? Born in the Colombian city of Medellín in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005. Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it. While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked. She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed. Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart. Karol G's style of music is more often described as ""reggaeton"". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish. While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Rocío Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer – and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos. ""Streaming democratised the landscape,"" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world. ""Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution."" Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%. Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this. And this year, Karol's G's Mañana Será Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify. This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Mañana Será Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist. Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event. ""There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,"" he adds. Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Español at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map. ""I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,"" she says. ""And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top. ""And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,"" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music. Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs ""Bichota"". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality. She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them. Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour. Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",,,,"Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift","Catherine Ellis, Business reporter, Reporting fromBogotá, Colombia",,,,,,,1

More than 12.6m cases and 7,700 deaths were recorded in what Paho says is the biggest outbreak in the region since records began in 1980. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia in South America and Mexico in North America were hit especially hard by the virus, accounting for the majority of cases and deaths. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause serious illness or death in some cases. Symptoms include a fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and a blotchy rash. Those with a more severe type of dengue might experience severe stomach pain, fatigue, vomiting, and blood in vomit or stool. Vaccines have been introduced in some countries in the region, while others, such as Honduras, plan to start distribution in 2025. In a statement, Paho urged for stronger mitigation efforts and collaboration across the Americas. Its director, Dr Jarbas Barbosa, said the high number of cases was linked to a hotter, wetter climate and factors such as accumulated water around the home and poor waste management, which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. He also said the virus was posing a ""higher-than-normal"" risk to children. In Guatemala, 70% of dengue-related deaths were children, while in Mexico, Costa Rica and Paraguay, under-15s made up more than a third of severe cases, Paho data showed.

,,,reliable,,"The number of people who have been reported missing in the violence-wracked Mexican state of Sinaloa has doubled since two rival factions of a drugs cartel started a bloody battle for control of their criminal organisation. According to official figures, more than 200 people have disappeared since the two factions of the Sinaloa cartel declared war on each other almost three months ago. The feud broke out after the arrest in the US of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. His followers, known as ""Los Mayos"" or ""La Mayiza"", say he was betrayed by the son of the infamous founder of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, and have turned on members of his faction, known as ""Los Chapitos"". Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has despatched her security chief, Omar García Harfuch, to Sinaloa state to quell the violence. The spike in murders and disappearances in Sinaloa has overshadowed Sheinbaum's first months in office. She was sworn in as Mexico's first female head of state on 1 October after a campaign in which she had promised to maintain the approach taken by her predecessor in office, who avoided direct confrontations with the cartels. ""There will be no return to the irresponsible drug war,"" she had said in her inaugural speech, ruling out a more militaristic approach. But faced with growing criticism in her own country and pressure from US President-elect Donald Trump, who wants Mexico to do more to curb the trafficking to the US of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, Sheinbaum on Wednesday appeared to make tackling the violence in Sinaloa her priority. In a news conference, she said her Administration would take a ""zero tolerance"" approach. She also praised the security forces for making Mexico's biggest fentanyl bust to date. ""This is an investigation that has been going on for a long time and yesterday, it gave these results. It is the largest seizure of fentanyl pills ever made,"" she said. Earlier, Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, had announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the fentanyl pills seized at two properties in Sinaloa were worth $394m (£309m) and weighed more than a tonne. ""These actions will continue until the violence diminishes in the state of Sinaloa,"" he said in the post [in Spanish]. News of the massive fentanyl bust came just over a week after Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada on day one of his presidency. He said the tariffs would remain in place until ""until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country"". Mexican officials also announced on Wednesday that they had detained more than 5,200 migrants across the country the previous day, in what appeared to be a response to President Sheinbaum's promise to Trump to stop a migrant caravan moving north through Mexico from reaching the US border.",,,,Disappearances double in Sinaloa amid Mexican cartel rift,"Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Dayane Leite never wanted to become a sex worker but at the age of 17 her husband died of a heart attack and she couldn’t pay for the funeral. Her home town, Itaituba in Brazil’s northern Para state, is at the heart of the country’s illegal gold-mining trade, so a friend suggested raising the money by having sex with miners, deep in the Amazon. “Going to the mines is a roll of the dice,” she says. “The women are seriously humiliated there. They may be slapped in the face and yelled at. “I was sleeping in my bedroom and a guy jumped through the window and put a gun to my head. And if they pay, they want to own the women.” Dayane successfully gathered the money for the funeral, and at the age of 18 she had her first child. For the last 16 years, like many women in Itaituba, she has been returning periodically to the mines to work as a cook, a washerwoman, a barmaid and a sex worker. She now has a family of seven to support. “I'm not going to say that all the women in the city do it, but a fair share of them do sex work. So it’s kind of normal. We don’t really care,” says Natalia Cavalcante, who became a sex worker in a remote mining settlement at 24. Four years later, after marrying the owner of a bar, she became the madam of a brothel – a job she only gave up recently, to look after her nieces in the city. Life in mining villages in the rainforest is harsh - most consist of just a dirt track, saloon bars and a church. But the miners themselves live even further out, in shacks made of wood and canvas, surrounded by snakes and jaguars, and in total darkness once the generator is switched off. Women working as cooks have to live in these camps, alongside the men. The miners appear in the village whenever they have found gold and have money to spend, Natalia adds. Sometimes they have to be persuaded to have a shower before sex, women say. Running a brothel is illegal under Brazilian law, but Natalia says she took no commission, she just employed bar staff and rented out rooms. Young women would contact her asking for work, and she sometimes lent them money for the journey, a seven-hour drive from Itaituba.",,,,Selling sex for gold in the Amazon's illegal mines,"Thais Carrança and Emma Ailes, BBC 100 Women and BBC Brasil",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The United Nations' Human Rights Committee has ordered Venezuela ""to refrain from destroying"" the voting tallies from July's presidential election. The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election. The government-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) declared the incumbent, President Nicolás Maduro, the winner but failed to provide the voting tallies to back up its claim. The opposition, which with the help of accredited election witnesses collected and published more than 80% of the voting tallies, says these prove that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner. The Human Rights Committee - a UN body made up of 18 independent experts - said it was investigating allegations of electoral fraud following a complaint brought by a law firm on behalf of a Venezuelan voter. As part of that investigation, the committee demanded that the Venezuelan state preserve the detailed voting data from the presidential election on 28 July. There has been huge pressure on the CNE - which is stacked with government loyalists - to release the voting tallies. But more than four months on from the election, it still has not done so, blaming an alleged computer hack on election night for its unprecedented failure to provide the data within 30 days of the election date. In contrast, the opposition quickly uploaded the voting tallies it had gathered onto a website. Independent observers and media, including the New York Times and CNN, say those tallies suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes compared to Maduro's 30%. But Nicolás Maduro has dismissed the tallies published by the opposition as ""fraudulent"" and maintains that he is the election winner. He is ploughing ahead with preparations for 10 January, when he says he will be sworn in to his third consecutive term in office. This has pitted him against a growing number of countries, including the United States, Italy, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Uruguay, which have recognised González as the president-elect of Venezuela. IHR Legal, the international law firm which brought the complaint before the UN Human Rights Committee, said the case was ""pioneering"" and ""historic"" and could lead to the committee ""confirming that Nicolás Maduro is not the president-elect of Venezuela"".",,,,UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies,"Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to clarify details of a conversation she had with US President-elect Donald Trump, after the two leaders offered differing accounts of the call. Following Wednesday's call, Trump said Sheinbaum had ""agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border"". This prompted Sheinbaum to say she had merely reiterated Mexico's position, which she said was ""not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and people"". The call followed Trump's announcement on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff of 25% on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on China. He said the import duties on Mexico and Canada would only be removed once illegal immigration and drug trafficking to the US had stopped. The announcement was initially met with combative language from President Sheinbaum, who vowed earlier on Wednesday to retaliate if the US triggered a trade war. ""If there are US tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,"" she said of the proposed duties, which appear to breach the USMCA trade deal that Trump himself struck in 2018 during his first presidency between the US, Mexico and Canada. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Mexican president said she did not specifically discuss tariffs in the phone call with Trump but that they had addressed immigration and fentanyl trafficking - the reasons Trump had named for imposing the tariffs in the first place. She said she had reassured him that a migrant caravan he had expressed concern about was ""not going to reach the [northern] Mexican frontier"" with the US but she stressed that ""it has never been our plan to close the border with the US"". Sheinbaum insisted that the conversation had been ""very amiable"" and that they had agreed they would ""continue with our talks"". In what appeared an altogether more conciliatory tone compared to her initial reaction to Trump's import tax announcement, she also insisted there was now ""no possibility of a tariff war"" between Mexico and the US. The flow of migrants from Mexico in the US has long overshadowed relations between the two neighbours and became a defining issue in the 2024 White House election race that culminated in Trump’s resounding victory this month. Under US diplomatic pressure, Mexico has been conducting its largest ever migrant crackdown, bussing and flying non-Mexican migrants to the country’s south, far from the US border. But Trump campaigned on a promise to seal the US-Mexico border and his threat to impose 25% tariffs was seen as an attempt to force Mexico into doing more to stop the migrants from reaching the US southern border. The Mexican government has in turn demanded that the US take action to stop the flow of weapons being smuggled from the US into Mexico. Sheinbaum told reporters on Thursday that she would raise the issue of guns with Trump ""in due time"". Earlier this week Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On Wednesday night, Trudeau held an emergency meeting with the leaders of the country's provinces and territories to discuss the tariff threat. According to a summary of the call, they were urged to ""make use of all of their contacts, channels, and abilities to relay important information and messages to Americans and people of influence"" about the deep economic and security ties between the US and Canada.",,,,Mexico leader responds to Trump claim she agreed to stop migration,"Will Grant and Vanessa Buschschlüter, BBC News, Mexico City and London",,,,,,,1

But economic and political turmoil, in particular left-wing urban guerrilla attacks in the early 1970s, led the government of the day to suspend the constitution and launch a period of repressive military rule that lasted until 1985.

Orsi beat Álvaro Delgado, the candidate for the governing conservative coalition, by more than three percentage points in Sunday's run-off. Delgado conceded defeat and congratulated Orsi and his Broad Front coalition, which will now return to power after five years of conservative rule. The Broad Front governed Uruguay for 15 years from 2005 to 2020 before being beaten by outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou - who under Uruguay's constitution was barred from standing for a second consecutive term in this election. Orsi, 57, is seen as a protege of former President José Mujica, who won the hearts of many in Uruguay through his modest lifestyle, prompting many to label him ""the world's poorest president"". Orsi himself comes from a humble background, having grown up in rural Uruguay in a house without electricity. While working as a school history teacher, he became active in local politics, eventually becoming mayor of Canelones, Uruguay's second-most populous department. During Orsi's time at the helm in Canelones, tech giant Google announced it would build a huge data centre in the department. Orsi struck a business-friendly note in his campaign, saying that he planned to avoid raising taxes that could scare off investors. Addressing his supporters on Sunday evening, he stressed he wanted to be a president for all 3.4 million Uruguayans, saying he would ""call for a national dialogue again and again"" and that he would listen to those who had voted for his rival. ""I'm going to be the president who builds a more integrated country, where we set aside our differences and nobody is left behind, neither economically, socially or politically."" Outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou said he would work with Orsi to ensure a smooth transition ahead of the swearing-in of the new president on 1 March next year. Orsi's Broad Front also won a majority in the Uruguyan Senate, but his coalition did not clinch a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.

Bolsonaro's vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto and 35 other people have also been indicted by federal police for attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d'état and criminal organisation. It comes after a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether Bolsonaro incited a failed coup after claiming the election was fraudulent. In a post on X, Bolsonaro said he would mount a legal ""fight"" against the claims, and accused investigators of being ""creative"" and doing ""everything that the law does not say"". In a statement, police said their probe ""found the existence of a criminal organisation that acted in a coordinated manner, in 2022, in an attempt to keep the then president of the republic in power"". Police have forwarded the report with the indictment of the 37 people to the court. The country's top prosecutor will now decide whether to press charges. Among those accused of being part of a criminal conspiracy to stage a coup are Bolsonaro's former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem, as well as former ministers Anderson Torres and Augusto Heleno. The indictment is a fresh blow for Bolsonaro's hard-right backers, who had hoped to overturn a ban blocking him from office in time to him to run for president in 2026. Earlier this week, federal police in Brazil arrested five people who are suspected of plotting to kill then president-elect Lula in the days before he took office. In the last few months, federal police have also formally accused Bolsonaro of tampering with his Covid-19 vaccination cards while in office and of benefiting from an illegal scheme to sell jewellery gifted to his government by Saudi Arabia. Bolsonaro was banned from running for office for eight years after being accused of undermining Brazilian democracy by falsely claiming that electronic ballots used in the October 2022 poll were vulnerable to hacking and fraud. The bitterly fought election was won by an extremely narrow margin by left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Mr Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat and left Brazil for the US two days before Lula was sworn in as president. His supporters, who refused to accept the outcome of the election, stormed Brazil's Congress, the presidential palace and the building housing the Supreme Court on 8 January 2023. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 of the rioters. In his X post, Bolsonaro added that he would wait to see what was in the indictment. ""I will wait for the lawyer.

The incident took place last week as violence continued to worsen in the country. An estimated 25 people were killed in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday alone in what police say was a foiled attempt at a gang invasion of a wealthy neighbourhood. Politically, the situation also remains critical with interim Prime Minister Garry Conille fired this month by the country's ruling council - less than six months after he took office. MSF says that on 11 November one of its ambulances carrying three young men with gunshot wounds was stopped by Haitian law enforcement officers. Apparently supported by a paramilitary self-defence group, the men attacked the vehicle, removed two of the patients, took them outside hospital grounds and executed them. The humanitarian group denounced the violence in a strongly worded statement last week, saying their personnel had been tear-gassed and held against their will for several hours. While that incident appears to have been the final straw for MSF in Port-au-Prince, at least for the time being, it was not the only recent example of extreme aggression against their staff. The announcement comes amid a worsening climate of violence in Haiti with some 25 suspected gang members killed in the capital on Tuesday.

Four of those detained on Tuesday are soldiers and one is a police officer, local media reported. The five were allegedly part of a plot to kill President-elect Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, on 15 December 2022, just over two weeks before the presidential inauguration. Lula was elected in October 2022, narrowly defeating incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who never publicly accepted defeat. A week after Lula was sworn in, Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace and vandalised the buildings. Police eventually cleared the buildings of the rioters and detained thousands. Investigations into the events of 8 January 2023 as well as previous alleged attempts to prevent Lula from being sworn in have been under way since. However, this is the first time that police have revealed an alleged attempt to assassinate Lula. Speaking after news of the arrests broke, Social Communications Minister Paulo Pimenta said that the alleged plot to assassinate Lula and Alckmin had almost gone ahead. ""It was just details which stopped it [from being carried out],"" the minister said. Brazilian news site G1 said that what was particularly worrying was that four of those arrested were active members of the military and the fifth a serving member of the police force. AFP news agency quoted a federal police source as saying that the four soldiers ""were arrested in Rio, where they were participating in the security operation for the G20 leaders' meeting"" currently under way in the Brazilian city. According to G1, the four soldiers, who had had special forces training, are accused of forming part of a criminal organisation plotting against Lula. Brazil's federal police said in a statement that its investigations ""indicate that the criminal organisation used a high level of technical-military knowledge to plan, coordinate and execute illicit actions in the months of November and December 2022"". According to the statement, the plotters had not just planned to assassinate the president-elect and the vice-president-elect but also wanted to arrest and execute a member of the Supreme Court once their coup was successful. Police said the plotters had nicknamed the operation ""green and yellow dagger"", in reference to the colours of the Brazilian flag. According to the federal police, the plotters had debated how to best ""neutralise"" Lula and Geraldo Alckmin and had allegedly settled on poisoning the president-elect.

So far, Honduran officials have confirmed only one death but said that more than 110,000 people had been affected by the storm. Forecasters say Sara is likely to further weaken on Monday as it moves over the southern Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Sara formed in the Caribbean Sea on Thursday. The tropical storm was extremely slow moving, dumping huge amounts of rain on northern Honduras for four days running before moving north to Belize and Mexico. Some areas saw 500mm (19.7 inches) of rain fall causing rivers to swell. Nine bridges were destroyed by fast flowing waters and another 19 damaged, Honduran emergency services said. Several highways also became impassable following landslides. Honduran President Xiomara Castro had warned citizens living near rivers as early as Thursday to take shelter elsewhere and thousands heeded her call.

The plan, drawn up by Egypt and endorsed by Arab leaders, has been rejected by Israel and by US President Donald Trump, who presented his own vision to turn the Gaza Strip into a ""Middle East Riviera"". On Saturday the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain welcomed the plan, which calls for Gaza to be rebuilt over five years, as ""realistic"". In a statement, they said the proposal promised ""swift and sustainable improvement of the catastrophic living conditions"" for the people of Gaza. The plan calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed to the territory. The committee would be responsible for overseeing humanitarian aid and temporarily managing Gaza's affairs under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority. The proposal is an alternative to Trump's idea for the US to take over Gaza and resettle its population. It was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas after it was presented by Egypt at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday. But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza. ""Residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,"" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump's National Security Council, said late on Tuesday. ""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,"" the statement added. The statement issued by the four European countries on Saturday said they were ""committed to working with the Arab initiative"" and they appreciated the ""important signal"" the Arab states had sent by developing it. The statement said Hamas ""must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more"" and that the four countries ""support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda"". The proposal was drawn up amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired on 1 March. Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has insisted the second phase should begin as agreed, leading to an end of the war and a full Israeli troop withdrawal. Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage. Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said 162 civilians have been killed in ""field executions"" in the region - a heartland of deposed president Bashir al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite sect. An interior ministry source told the country's official news agency Sana that ""individual violations"" had occurred on the coast and pledged to put a stop to them. BBC News has not been able to verify claims that the killings were committed by the forces of Syria's new rulers. The total killed includes 13 women and five children, the SOHR told the AFP news agency. Syria's new rulers, who ousted Assad in December, said a military operation is now being launched in the former president's home town of Qardaha. In his first statement since the violence broke out, the country's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said Syria would pursue the ""remnants"" of the ousted Assad regime and bring them to trial, Reuters reports. This follows clashes between government forces and fighters loyal to Assad, which left more than 70 dead. A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Homs, Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out, and the governor of Latakia has said all power to the province has been cut. Earlier, BBC Verify confirmed two videos that showed a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia. The violence has left the Alawite community in ""a state of horror"", a Syrian activist in the city told BBC Newshour. ""They are feeling so fearful. They are in a state of shock,"" said the activist, who did not want to use his name for fear of reprisals. ""They don't know what to do. There is no government or state who is ready to help them, to protect them, "" he added. The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said in a statement he was ""deeply concerned"" by reports of the clashes and killings. He called on all parties to ""refrain from actions that could further inflame tensions, escalate conflict, exacerbate the suffering of affected communities, destabilize Syria, and jeopardize a credible and inclusive political transition."" The region is the heartland of the Alawite minority and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belongs to the sect. Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them. Residents say they have been targets of sectarian violence, with one Alawite woman telling BBC Arabic that many Syrians are ""scared"" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital. She added that ""everyone is terrified from the current incitement"", and fears they will become ""scapegoats"". Turkey and Russia have warned that the bloodshed, the worst since the toppling of Assad in December, threatens the stability of the entire region.

,,,reliable,,"As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD. Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site. Now neuroscientists working with survivors from the festival say there are early signs that MDMA - also known as ecstasy or molly - may have provided some psychological protection against trauma. The preliminary results, currently being peer-reviewed with a view to publication in the coming months, suggest that the drug is associated with more positive mental states - both during the event and in the months afterwards. The study, carried out by scientists at Israel's Haifa University, could contribute to a growing scientific interest in how MDMA might be used to treat psychological trauma. It is thought to be the first time scientists have been able to study a mass trauma event where large numbers of people were under the influence of mind-altering drugs. Hamas gunmen killed 360 people and kidnapped dozens more at the festival site where 3,500 people had been partying. ""We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA,"" said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research. ""There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation - is it going to be worse, or better?"" The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival. Two-thirds of these were under the influence of recreational drugs including MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin - the compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms - before the attacks took place. ""MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective,"" the study has found, according to Prof Salomon. He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place. ""They were sleeping better, had less mental distress - they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance,"" he said. The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug - such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding - helped reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack. And even more importantly, they say, it appears to have left survivors more open to receiving love and support from their families and friends once they were home. Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape. But researchers found that many survivors, like Michal Ohana, firmly believe it did play a role - and say that belief, in itself, may help them to recover from the event. ""I feel like it saved my life, because I was so high, like I'm not in the real world,"" she told me. ""Because regular humans can't see all these things - it's not normal."" Without the drug, she believes she would have just frozen or collapsed to the floor, and been killed or captured by the gunmen. Clinicians in various countries have already experimented with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a trial setting - though only Australia has approved it as a treatment. Countries that have rejected it include the US, where the Food and Drug Administration cited concerns about the design of the studies, that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, and about the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse. MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and has been linked to liver, kidney and heart problems. In Israel, where MDMA is also illegal, psychologists can only use it to treat clients on an experimental research basis. The preliminary findings from the Nova study are being closely followed by some of those Israeli clinicians experimenting with MDMA as treatment for PTSD after 7 October. Dr Anna Harwood-Gross, a clinical psychologist and director of research at Israel's Metiv Psychotrauma Centre, described the initial findings as ""really important"" for therapists like her. She is currently experimenting with using MDMA to treat PTSD within the Israeli military, and had worried about the ethics of inducing a vulnerable psychological state in clients when there is a war going on. ""At the beginning of the war, we questioned whether we were able to do this,"" she said. ""Can we give people MDMA when there's a risk of an air raid siren? That's going to re-traumatise them potentially. This study has shown us that even if there's a traumatic event during therapy, the MDMA might also help process that trauma."" Dr Harwood-Gross says early indications of therapeutic MDMA use are encouraging, even among military veterans with chronic PTSD. It has also upended old assumptions about the ""rules"" of therapy - especially the length of sessions, which have to be adjusted when working with clients under the influence of MDMA, she says. ""For example, it's changed our thoughts about 50-minute therapy sessions, with one patient and one therapist,"" Dr Harwood-Gross told me. ""Having two therapists, and long sessions - up to eight hours long - is a new way of doing therapy. They're looking at people very holistically and giving them time."" She says this new longer format is showing promising results, even without patients taking MDMA, with a success rate of 40% in the placebo group. Israeli society itself has also changed its approach to trauma and therapy following the 7 October attacks, according to Danny Brom, a founding director of the METIV Psychotrauma Centre at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, and a senior figure in the industry. ""It's as if this is the first trauma we're going through,"" he said. ""I've seen wars here, I've seen lots of terrorist attacks and people said, 'We don't see trauma here'. ""Suddenly, there seems to be a general opinion that now everyone is traumatised, and everyone needs treatment. It's a wrong approach."" What broke, he said, is the sense of security many Jews believed Israel would provide them. These attacks uncovered a collective trauma, he says, linked to the Holocaust and generations of persecution. ""Our history is full of massacres,"" psychologist Vered Atzmon Meshulam told me. ""As a psychologist now in Israel, we are faced with an opportunity to work with lots of traumas that weren't previously being treated, like all our narratives for 2,000 years."" Collective trauma, combat trauma, mind-altering drugs, sexual assault, hostages, survivors, body-collectors, the injured and the bereaved - Israel's trauma specialists are facing a complex cocktail of issues from the clients now flooding into therapy. The scale of that mental health challenge is mirrored in Gaza, where vast numbers of people have been killed, injured or left homeless after a devastating 15-month war - and where there are scant resources to help a deeply traumatised population. The war in Gaza, triggered by the Hamas attacks on Israeli communities in October 2023, was suspended in January in a six-week truce, during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. But there is little sense on either side that the peace and security needed to begin healing has arrived. The truce expired last weekend, with 59 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. Many Gazans are waiting, with their bags packed, for war to resume. Meanwhile Nova survivor Michal Ohana says she feels that with the passage of time, some are expecting her to have moved on from the attacks, but she is still affected. ""I wake up with this, and I go to sleep with this, and people don't understand,"" she told me.",,,,"Party drug MDMA may have protected survivors of Nova attack from trauma, study suggests","Lucy Williamson, Middle East correspondent",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"In January, days after the first-month anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime in a lightning Islamist-led rebel offensive in Syria, a group of young men - some of them armed - were gathered, checking their phones in the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus. With Bashar al-Assad gone, they had arrived from Idlib, a region in the country's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country. Virtually overnight, they had been catapulted to positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, were in charge of a fractured country devastated by 13 years of civil war. One of them, around 30 years old, had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official, and welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed. Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous security challenges, including the threat coming from Assad loyalists. The dismantling of the decades-old apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, such as the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people. ""There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process,"" said the official, who requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government. ""Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids."" Since then the violence has escalated, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, a stronghold of the Assad family, but clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday. As forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia province, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen. At least 13 members of the security forces were killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, in what a regional official described as a well-planned attack carried out by ""remnants of the Assad militias"". Initially limited to the Jableh area, the unrest spread more widely. Videos posted online showed heavy gunfire in different areas. The authorities sent reinforcements and, on Friday, further clashes killed more than 120 people, the Syrian Observatory said. It marked the most violent day since Assad's fall and the biggest challenge yet to interim President Sharaa's transitional government and his efforts to consolidate authority. According to the Institute for the Study of War, a research group, former Assad regime members are likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to coordinate attacks. ""[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organize insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,"" they said in a report. Syria's coastal areas are also the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Its members held prominent roles in the Assad government but, with the arrival of Sunni Muslim-led rebels, lost the power and privilege they once had. They now say they are under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects. On Friday, activists said gunmen had killed dozens of male residents in Alawite areas, which will further exacerbate tensions – and possibly drive support for insurgents in their anti-government push. The Syrian Observatory said the gunmen were from the government's security forces, although this has not been verified. The authorities also faced resistance from the Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached earlier this week The government in Damascus does not control the whole of Syria, where different factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions. But for Sharaa, the challenge goes beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. As Western suspicions over his intentions continue, his authorities are also struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty.",,,,Syrian government still faces threat from Assad loyalists,"Hugo Bachega, BBC Middle East correspondent, Reporting fromBeirut, Lebanon",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Security forces of Syria's new rulers have engaged in heavy fighting with fighters loyal to deposed President Bashar al-Assad in a coastal area of the country. It is the worst violence in Syria since rebels toppled Assad in December and installed an Islamist transitional government. A war monitoring group, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 70 people have been killed. A curfew has been imposed in the cities of Latakia and Tartous, where the fighting has broken out. BBC Verify confirmed the location of two videos posted online that showed gunmen shooting repeatedly at a building, igniting a fire inside, in the city of Homs on Thursday evening. Two other verified videos show a body being dragged behind a car in Latakia. The coastal region is the heartland of the Alawite minority, and a stronghold of the Assad family, which belong to the Alawite sect. Estimations of the number of people killed in the violence vary, and the BBC has been unable to independently verify them. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday that 71 people had been killed, including 35 members of government forces, 32 gunmen affiliated to the former regime's army, and four civilians. The clashes left tens of others injured, the human rights group said. Gunmen, some from the former regime, had ambushed military forces, checkpoints and headquarters along the coastline, the organisation said. One Sunni civilian witness called the attack ""planned and prepared"", while another told BBC Arabic that the indiscriminate firing on everyone including paramedics, was like something from the previous Assad regime. ""They did not have any mercy, so we are against any violence against anyone in the Syrian coast who has not been involve in this unrest. All of them are civilians and they are all like our family,"" they explained. One Alawite said many Syrian people are ""scared"" regardless of if they were on the coast or in the capital. Speaking to the BBC, she added that ""everyone is terrified from the current incitement"", and fears they will become ""scapegoats"". Local gunmen took hold of military zones, where they holed up in areas in the Latakia mountains to launch attacks, while others holed up in Jableh city. Members of the former regime army have been deployed in several coastal towns and villages, while military forces have been ambushed on highways. Late on Thursday, Syrian-based Step news agency reported that government-aligned forces had killed ""about 70"" former regime fighters, while more than 25 others were captured in Jableh and the surrounding areas.

,,,reliable,,"Syria's foreign minister has told the global chemical weapons watchdog that the new government is committed to destroying any remaining stockpiles produced under ousted president Bashar al-Assad. Addressing a meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, Asaad al-Shibani vowed to ""put an end to this painful legacy, to bring justice to victims, and to ensure that the compliance with international law is a solid one"". But he added that Syria would ""need the support of the international community"". Assad's government denied ever using chemical weapons during the 14-year civil war, but activists accused it of carrying out of dozens of chemical attacks. In 2013, rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs in Eastern and Western Ghouta, killing hundreds of people. UN experts confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin but they were not asked to ascribe any blame. Assad denied his forces fired the rockets, but he did agree to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and allow a joint OPCW-UN mission to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal. However, questions about the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration remained. The OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team documented multiple uses of chemical weapons during the war, identifying the Syrian military as the perpetrator of five cases of chemical weapons use in 2017 and 2018. They included the April 2018 attack on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta, when a Syrian air force helicopter is believed to have dropped two cylinders filled with highly concentrated chlorine gas on two apartment buildings, killing at least 43 people. An earlier OPCW fact-finding mission, which was not mandated to identify perpetrators, also found that chemical weapons were used or likely used in 20 other instances. Last month, OPCW director general Fernando Arias visited Damascus to hold talks with Shibani and interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad in December. At Wednesday's meeting, Arias declared that ""the evolving political landscape in Syria"" provided the international community with ""a new and historic opportunity to complete the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programme"". He said a team of technical experts from the OPCW would be deployed to Damascus in the coming days and begin planning visits to suspected chemical weapon sites. Shibani also met the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, in The Hague on Wednesday. The ICC said their talks ""followed up on the prosecutor's January visit to Damascus, exploring partnerships towards accountability for crimes committed in Syria"". Syria is not a member of the ICC, but Khan has said the new government could accept the court's jurisdiction as a first step, as Ukraine has done with respect to the war with Russia.",,,,Syria vows to destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons,"David Gritten, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Food prices in Gaza have risen sharply and aid food parcels could soon run out after Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid, the UN's humanitarian agency said. OCHA's partners reported that flour and vegetable prices had more than doubled in some cases, with Gazans telling the BBC the same. If the blockade continued, ""at least 80 community kitchens may soon run out of stock"" and remaining food parcels that ""will support 500,000 people, will soon run out"", OCHA said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to stop aid at the weekend, accusing Hamas of stealing supplies and refusing a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire. A Hamas spokesman said the halt was ""cheap blackmail"". The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza ""catastrophic"" and expressing deep concern at Israel's action. ""A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law,"" the statement read. ""Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool."" The ministers said it was vital that the ceasefire was sustained, all hostages held by Hamas were released, and continued flows of aid were ensured. Thousands of aid trucks had surged into Gaza each week under the ceasefire deal that started on 19 January. After the ceasefire's first phase expired on Saturday night, Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of stealing aid ""to finance its terror machine"". Hamas has previously denied stealing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Netanyahu also said Hamas was refusing to accept a six-week ceasefire extension, under different terms from those previously agreed, as proposed by US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. After the halt of aid in response, OCHA said on Tuesday that some community kitchens which remain operational ""will need to start to adjust meal content or reduce the number of meals prepared to cope with anticipated shortages"". Partners would also ""be forced to reduce food rations"". While they are distributing previously dispatched food parcels, remaining supplies are expected to run out. Abu Qais Aryan, from Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic the cost of basic goods doubled over Sunday night. Prices had already doubled or tripled since the war began, he said. Other residents said the price of a 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes rose overnight from five shekels ($1.38; £1.07) to 10, and a 1kg of cucumbers from six to 17 shekels. ""We could barely afford to buy a kilo of tomatoes just to satisfy our hunger,"" said one man, Issam, adding that people could not buy food ""because there is no cash liquidity"". Issa Meit, from Gaza City, said there was a shortage of goods and very high consumption, and he was ""very afraid that prices will increase again"". ""The recent decision is unfair as it wrongs our children. How will our children live in light of these high prices that will increase in an arbitrary way?"" he said. Some blamed merchants for hiking prices, saying they were exploiting the situation. Merchant Mahmoud Abu Mohsen told BBC Arabic he raised prices because the wholesalers he purchases from did as well. ""For example, I used to buy sugar for five shekels, three shekels, or four shekels, but now I buy sugar for six shekels, meaning I don't make more than a small profit,"" he said. ""The news that Netanyahu announced is what caused a stir among the people."" A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Caroline Seguin, told the BBC on Wednesday that in Gaza City, the price of just over 2lb (900g) of sugar had risen from just over $1 (78p) to $5. In Khan Younis and Gaza City, the cost of a carton of 30 eggs had shot up around 150%, she added. ""The news has created uncertainty and fear, causing food prices to spike,"" Ms Seguin said in an earlier statement. ""Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences."" Qatar and Egypt, which helped mediate the ceasefire along with the US, condemned Israel's move. Qatar's foreign ministry called the decision ""a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement"" and ""international humanitarian law"" in a statement. Egypt's foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as ""a weapon against the Palestinian people"". Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said in a video briefing that ""Hamas has hoarded for months and months of supplies. They have enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic."" ""The supplies are there but Hamas doesn't share,"" he added. A month ago, OCHA said more than a million people - roughly half of Gaza's population - had received food assistance since the ceasefire began. All aid, not just food, is affected by the blockade. Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said that inside Gaza, it had some medicine in reserve for its clinics and assistive devices for people with disabilities, in addition to hygiene kits. ""However, we don't currently have high aid reserves as most items entering were for immediate distribution,"" the charity said. Ms Seguin said even though it appeared MSF's medical supplies would last for a few months, ""it doesn't mean that we haven't been consistently running short of essentials"". The main concern for the health system, she said, was fuel for generators at hospitals to ensure ventilators and other critical medical equipment continued to work. She said ""the consequences will be at the cost of the people in Gaza"". The ceasefire aimed to end 15 months of conflict, which erupted after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.

,,,reliable,,"Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury. It is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza. Rami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort. His bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered. Every step forward is hard. Doctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs. Warning - This article contains distressing content The boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children. Rami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces. His heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial. The UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. Medical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment. An estimated 30,000 Gazans – like Rami and Abdul Salam – have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. It has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people – among them 4,500 children – still need to be brought out for treatment. ""The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,"" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January. Rami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved. ""Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'"" Islam says. And then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman. It is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more. ""It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,"" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. ""It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery."" Rami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small ""School of the Future"", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner. But he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him. They're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can. ""Gaza is beautiful,"" Rami told me. ""In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped."" With the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress. ""He arrived in a wheelchair,"" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. ""He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud."" He also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza. But many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home. Not knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. Sharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs. He was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings.

,,,reliable,,"The level of destruction in Jabalia when viewed from the air is truly astonishing. A Hiroshima-like wasteland stretches as far as the eye can see. The mangled carcasses of buildings dot the churned-up landscape, some leaning at crazy angles. Great undulating waves of rubble make it all but impossible to make out the geography of this once bustling, tightly packed refugee camp. And yet, as a drone camera flies over the wreckage, it picks out splashes of blue and white where small tent camps have been set up in patches of open ground. And figures, clambering over broken buildings, moving along streets of dirt, where food markets are springing up under tin roofs and canvas awnings. Children using a collapsed roof as a slide. After more than six weeks of Gaza's fragile ceasefire, Jabalia is slowly coming back to life. In the neighbourhood of al-Qasasib, Nabil has returned to a four-storey house that's somehow still standing, even if it lacks windows, doors and - in some places - walls. He and his relatives have made crude balconies out of wooden pallets and strung-up tarpaulin to keep out the elements. ""Look at the destruction,"" he says as he surveys Jabalia's ocean of ruins from a gaping upper floor. ""They want us to leave without rebuilding it? How can we leave. The least we can do is rebuild it for our children."" To cook a meal, Nabil lights a fire on the bare staircase, stoking it carefully with pieces of torn-up cardboard. On another floor, Laila Ahmed Okasha washes up in a sink where the tap ran dry months ago. ""There's no water, electricity or sewage,"" she says. ""If we need water, we have to go to a far place to fill up buckets."" She says she cried when she came back to the house and found it wrecked. She blames Israel and Hamas for destroying the world she once knew. ""Both of them are responsible,"" she says. ""We had a decent, comfortable life."" Soon after the war began in October 2023, Israel told Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip – including Jabalia – to move south for their own safety. Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the warning, but many stayed, determined to ride out the war. Laila and her husband Marwan clung on until October last year, when the Israeli military reinvaded Jabalia, saying Hamas had reconstituted fighting units inside the camp's narrow streets. After two months of sheltering in nearby Shati camp, Leila and Marwan returned to find Jabalia almost unrecognisable. ""When we came back and saw how it was destroyed, I didn't want to stay here anymore,"" Marwan says. ""I had a wonderful life, but now it's a hell. If I have the chance to leave, I'll go. I won't stay one more minute."" Stay or go? The future of Gaza's civilian population is now the subject of international debate. In February, Donald Trump suggested that the US should take over Gaza and that nearly two million Palestinian residents should leave, possibly for good. Faced with international outrage and fierce opposition from Arab leaders, Trump has subsequently appeared to back away from the plan, saying he recommended it but would not force it on anyone. In the meantime, Egypt has led Arab efforts to come up with a viable alternative, to be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Crucially, it says the Palestinian population should remain inside Gaza while the area is reconstructed. Donald Trump's intervention has brought out Gaza's famously stubborn side. ""If Trump wants to make us leave, I'll stay in Gaza,"" Laila says. ""I want to travel on my own free will. I won't leave because of him."" Across the way sits a nine-storey yellow block of flats so spectacularly damaged it's hard to believe it hasn't collapsed. The upper floors have caved in entirely, threatening the rest. In time, it will surely have to be demolished, but for now it's home to yet more families. There are sheets in the windows and washing hanging to dry in the late winter sunshine. Most incongruously of all, outside a makeshift plastic doorway on a corner of the ground floor, next to piles of rubble and rubbish, stands a headless mannequin, wearing a wedding gown. It's Sanaa Abu Ishbak's dress shop. The 45-year-old seamstress, mother of 11, set up the business two years before the war but had to abandon it when she fled south in November 2023. She came back as soon as the ceasefire was announced. With her husband and daughters, she's been busy clearing debris from the shop, arranging dresses on hangers and getting ready for business. ""I love Jabalia camp,"" she says, ""and I won't leave it till I die."" Sanaa and Laila seem equally determined to stay put if they can. But both women speak differently when they talk of the young. ""She doesn't even know how to write her own name,"" Laila says of her granddaughter. ""There's no education in Gaza."" The little girl's mother was killed during the war. Laila says she still talks to her at night. ""She was the soul of my soul and she left her daughter in my hands.

The deal involves exchanging hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel in stages, and aims to end the war. But the process has now reached an impasse, raising fears of a return to fighting. The war was triggered when Hamas attacked on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.

,,,reliable,,"A British-Israeli hostage released by Hamas after 15 months in captivity has said her scars represented ""freedom, hope and strength"" as she underwent a series of surgeries for her injuries. Emily Damari, 28, was shot in the hand as she was dragged from her home in southern Israel during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, causing her to lose two fingers. She said an operation in Gaza had left her in ""intense pain"" for a year and a half, and that a scar from an ""open, festering wound"" did not heal for months due to the conditions in which she was held. Ahead of her treatment, Ms Damari said she had ""fully embraced"" the pain and injuries because of what they symbolise to her. Ms Damari was held by Hamas in Gaza for 471 days prior to her release. She was one of the first hostages to be freed as part of a ceasefire deal struck between the Palestinian armed group and Israel after 15 months of fighting. She was taken from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, near the Gaza border, on the morning of Hamas's unprecedented attack. Ms Damari was also shot in the leg, and previously said she had only received an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat her wounds while in captivity. The 28-year-old said the complex operations on her hand and leg in Israel's Sheba Medical Center had gone ""much better than expected"". She said the scar on her hand was ""looking better"" and that the pain, caused by ""the nerves being sewn together"" in Gaza, had gone. Now, with the help of physiotherapy, she hoped to have improved use of her hand. But Ms Damari noted that her recovery would take time and her hand would ""never fully recover"". She said the conditions in which hostages were being held were ""unimaginable"". ""It was shocking but not surprising to see how emaciated some of the other hostages were when they came out,"" she reflected. ""Hamas has created hell on Earth,"" she said, adding that there were others whose mental and physical health was ""in much worse shape"" than hers. She called for the release of all remaining hostages without delay. Ms Damari's mother, who grew up in Beckenham in south-east London, added that her daughter had been ""sewn up like a pin-cushion"" in Gaza. ""It is nothing short of a miracle that she did not contract a life-threatening infection,"" said Mandy Damari. Ms Damari said she was ""so excited"" to visit the UK with her mother once she had healed and the remaining hostages are released. ""I have so many people that I want to thank personally for helping me get my life back."" The pair have been invited to Downing Street by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who previously spoke to Ms Damari over the phone. During that conversation, she said she had been held at United Nations facilities during her captivity. The UN's Gaza agency has called for an independent investigation into the allegation. In total, 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and a further 1,200 people were killed. The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's military offensive killed at least 48,365 people, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

,,,reliable,,"Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension. The first phase of a truce deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. A Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was ""cheap blackmail"" and a ""coup"" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene. The ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages. The first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday. Negotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun. Phase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years. Hamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place. As the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. If, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war. Witkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.

,,,reliable,,"Where next? The first six-week phase of the Gaza ceasefire ends on Saturday. The 42 days since 19 January have seen their fair share of uncertainty, hope, grief and anger, but everything that should have happened in that time has. Israeli hostages - the living and the dead - have been released. Palestinian prisoners set free. But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun. Talks opened in Cairo on Friday but Israel's delegation returned home in the evening. Reports suggested that negotiations would continue ""at a distance"" and that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold late-night consultations with the delegation, senior ministers and intelligence chiefs. For such a meeting to take place late on the sabbath was highly unusual. No statements emerged from the consultations, with reports suggesting they would continue on Saturday night. Israel appears to be looking to extend the current phase for another six weeks, to get more hostages back and release more Palestinian prisoners but without withdrawing its troops. The government here is adamant that Hamas, the group responsible for the massacres of 7 October 2023 and the taking of 251 hostages, has to lay down its arms and relinquish any form of authority in the Gaza Strip. Israel also says it is not yet ready to leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border - a process that should have begun on Saturday. ""We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,"" an unnamed Israeli official said in a statement sent to reporters on Friday. Such anonymous quotes are often believed to come directly from the prime minister's office. Last summer, efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza faltered when Netanyahu insisted on keeping Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor. On Friday night, Hamas said it would not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that phase two would eventually take place. Hamas seems determined to remain a force in Gaza, even if it might be willing to hand over day-to-day governance to other Palestinian actors, including the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. Egypt has been working on a reconstruction plan for Gaza, as an alternative to Donald Trump's proposal to take the area over and evacuate its entire civilian population. But Western diplomats are not optimistic that the plan, due to be unveiled at an Arab League summit in Cairo next Tuesday, has the sort of robust security and governance arrangements that will be needed to meet Israeli demands. This is a critical moment. For all the emotional turmoil of the last few weeks, Israelis have come to expect the gradual release of hostages. There are believed to be 24 alive, still waiting to be freed, with another 39 presumed to be dead. Israelis desperately want them all back, without the sort of propaganda displays that have disgusted and infuriated the entire country. If the whole process now grinds to a halt, public anger – at Hamas and their own government - will mount. Further street protests are planned, including one on Saturday night in the place in Tel Aviv that all Israelis now know as Hostages Square. ""We demand the return of all 59 remaining hostages by day 50 of the agreement,"" reads the invitation from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum HQ. ""Now is our only window of opportunity – we won't get another."" UN Secretary General António Guterres has weighed in, urging the parties ""to spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal"". On Saturday evening, Israelis were once again horrified by the sight of hostages being paraded in front of the cameras, in a video released by Hamas. In the latest in a long line of cruel, harrowing videos released over the past 16 months, five Israeli hostages are seen, two of them with their faces blurred. Two of the hostages, Iair Horn and Sagui Dekel Chen, were released two weeks ago. In the video, Iair is seen embracing and saying goodbye to his younger brother, Eitan, suggesting the scene was filmed shortly before Iair and Sagui were released. The emotions are raw and the scene deeply distressing, with both brothers in tears and Eitan pleading to Benjamin Netanyahu to stick with the ceasefire deal and release all remaining hostages. The video is clearly designed, once again, to play on the frayed emotions of the Israeli public and heap pressure on the Israeli prime minister. In a statement released by his office, Netanyahu accused Hamas of producing ""another cruel propaganda video in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare."" Israel, the statement said, would not be deterred by Hamas propaganda. ""We will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages and until all objectives of the war are met."" There's a widespread belief that, sooner or later, the war will begin again. It's a bleak prospect, for the hostages and for two million Palestinians in Gaza who are trying to put their lives back together in the current, fragile peace. In a place where families are still digging bodies from the rubble, sometimes with their bare hands, the thought of a resumption of a conflict which has already claimed tens of thousands of lives is chilling. Areas in the middle of the Gaza Strip that have so far escaped the worst of the conflict would likely suffer badly from any return to war, making it even harder to sustain life in this ravaged strip of land.",,,,Gaza ceasefire deal hits critical moment as first phase ends,"Paul Adams, Diplomatic correspondent, Reporting fromJerusalem",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered. The handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. It was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next. Hamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter. Hamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire. Israeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. It came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day. Following the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones ""were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel"". ""Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza,"" it added. ""Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip."" There was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas. Tsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents. His family said that ""the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body"". Itzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack. Ohad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.

The Israeli prime minister's office announced the four bodies would be returned ""without Hamas ceremonies"", while the Israel Prison Service said it was preparing to free prisoners and detainees from Gaza. Hamas also confirmed the exchange, and the Prisoners' Media Office said a hospital in Gaza was preparing to receive released Palestinians. This would clear the way for US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to visit the region. He has said he wants Israel and Hamas to begin delayed talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, with the first due to expire on Saturday. News of the breakthrough came as thousands of Israelis gathered along roads in central and southern Israel to watch the funeral procession of hostages Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned by Hamas last week.

This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces. But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting. A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014. IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months. Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary. At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ). As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives. But in the main square, the mood is festive.

Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation.

The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight. The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters. The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago.

,,,reliable,,"Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a ""historic"" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"". The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government. But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited. The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez. In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days. Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them. Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition. ""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday. ""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."" The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model. The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee. Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war. He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory. ""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."" The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks. Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not. However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"". Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"". Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved. ""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said. The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities. During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war. They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy. On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference.

In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to ""enter the area south of Damascus"". ""We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,"" he added. ""Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria."" He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy. Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side. The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum. But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger. Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019. Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973. He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel. But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape. Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances. Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words. From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past. Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had. Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country. There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad. How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era. But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership. To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide. Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.",,,,Israel demands complete demilitarisation of southern Syria,"Sebastian Usher, BBC Middle East analyst, Reporting fromJerusalem",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including ""humiliating"" handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to ""grave danger"" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was ""precarious"" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the ""dignified release of all remaining hostages"". On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a ""sickening display of cruelty"". There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys ""with their bare hands"", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". ""It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."" Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a ""blatant violation"" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. ""We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,"" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that ""all options are on the table"". ""Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],"" he added. ""Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?"" Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an ""appropriate response"" to what it called the ""barbaric treatment"" of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting ""an extension of phase one"". ""We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,"" he told CNN on Sunday. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",,,,Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners,"David Gritten, BBC News",,,,,,,1

Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams were now ""empty"" and would be occupied by the Israeli military for the coming year. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has deployed a tank division around the city of Jenin - the first time it has done so since 2002. The Palestinian Authority condemned the move. The UN said earlier this month that Israel's operation, which began on 21 January and was intensified in recent days, had led to the ""forced displacement"" of 40,000 people. ""So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents,"" Israel Katz said in a statement. ""I have instructed [troops] to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism."" He also said that Israel had instructed the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) to stop operating in the area. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described the decision to deploy tanks as a ""dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm"". The IDF said in a statement that its forces are ""continuing the operation to thwart terrorism"" and are expanding their ""offensive activity"" - which so far has involved drones, tanks, special forces, border police, and operatives from the intelligence agency Shin Bet. The UN said on Thursday that since Israeli operations began on 21 January, 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas governorates, as well as three Israeli soldiers. The offensive has caused severe damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, disrupting access to water to ""tens of thousands of people"", it said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Tulkarm refugee camp on Friday and ordered the army to intensify ""operational activity"", his office said. ""We are entering terrorist strongholds, flattening entire streets that terrorists use, and their homes. We are eliminating terrorists, commanders,"" Netanyahu said. His visit followed the explosion of three buses in Tel Aviv, which Israeli officials described as a ""suspected terror attack"" that was caused by bombs of the kind previously found in the West Bank. Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Six Day War and has since built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews.

,,,reliable,,"As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt. After the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go. But that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its ""cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement. It's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza. Israel complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud. In response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday. Hamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled. That prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed. With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them. And just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day. Netanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called a ""cruel and evil violation"" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers. All these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time. Hamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war. Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza. In Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else. Trump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal. Arab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan. The future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals. These issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate. But for now, the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US may have their work cut out just getting the first phase of the ceasefire over the line.",,,,Gaza ceasefire once again in doubt as first phase nears end,"Sebastian Usher, BBC Middle East analyst, Reporting fromJerusalem",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Israel says it is indefinitely delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, in another potentially major setback in the ceasefire process. Benjamin Netanyahu said the release was now going to be delayed until the next handover of hostages by Hamas was guaranteed - and without what the Israeli prime minister called the degrading ceremonies Hamas has put on each week. Only one more handover - of the bodies of four hostages who died in captivity - is due to take place in the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is due to end on 1 March. No arrangements for the release of other living hostages, due to take place in the second phase, have yet been made. Delegations from Israel and Hamas were due to negotiate the exact terms of the second phase while the first was ongoing - but have yet to meet. Mediators will be working overtime to get the deal back on track and avert a possible collapse, after both Israel and Hamas accused one another of breaking the terms of the agreement. Netanyahu accused Hamas of ""repeated violations"", including the ""cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes"". In response, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq strongly condemned the decision to postpone the release of the prisoners in a statement on Sunday morning. He said that Israel's claim that the handover ceremonies were humiliating was a ""false claim and a flimsy argument"" aimed at evading its obligations under the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu's statement came after four hostages taken captive on 7 October - Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Omer Wenkert - were released on Saturday. The two other released hostages, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, were held in Gaza for years - Mr Mengistu since 2014 and Mr al-Sayed since 2015. In exchange, Israel was supposed to release 602 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement by delaying the release. The six Israeli hostages are the final living hostages to be returned as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, outside the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, family and friends waited for the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to Palestinian authorities, 50 prisoners who were going to be released were serving life sentences, 60 had long sentences, and 445 were detained by Israel since 7 October. There are 62 hostages taken on 7 October 2023 still being held by Hamas, about half of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas began releasing hostages, facilitated by the Red Cross, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners after the ceasefire agreement took effect on 19 January. Initial chaotic scenes have become more choreographed, with hostages flanked by fighters on stages before the handovers. On Saturday, Mr Shoham, 40, and Mr Mengistu, 39, were passed to the Red Cross in Rafah in southern Gaza before being transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Mr Shoham was visiting family at Kibbutz Be'eri in October 2023 when he and others, including his wife and two children, were kidnapped by Hamas.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was ""horrified and devastated"" that Shiri had not been returned, ""despite the agreement and our desperate hopes"". The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February. Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz. The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun. Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

It was thought the remains of Shiri, a mother of two, had been handed over along with those of her children. But the Israeli military said forensic testing could only confirm the bodies of Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and not those of their mother. Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"", with Ismail al-Thawabta, a spokesman for Hamas, suggesting Shiri's remains had been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike. In a separate statement, the group said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" under the ceasefire - and that it had ""no interest in non-compliance"". It also said an investigation was under way, and called for the remains of the alleged Palestinian woman mistakenly handed over to Israel to be returned. The Bibas family were among 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, along with Shiri's husband, Yarden, who was released earlier this month. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Ariel and Kfir, the youngest of the Israeli hostages, were aged four and nine months when they were kidnapped. Their mother was 32. Netanyahu has threatened that Hamas will pay the ""full price"" for failing to hand over Shiri's body, calling it a ""cruel and evil violation"" of their agreement. No measures have yet been announced beyond Netanyahu saying Israel will act ""with determination to bring Shiri home"". But a further claim from Israel that Ariel and Kfir had been ""murdered by terrorists in cold blood"" will further inflame feelings in Israel. In November 2023, Hamas claimed the boys and Shiri had been killed in an IDF air strike. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed forensic tests had revealed that Hamas killed Ariel and Kfir ""with their bare hands"". ""Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities,"" he said, without giving specifics about the alleged injuries. Hamas has not yet responded to these accusations. For Israeli politicians inside and outside Netanyahu's government who have been demanding a resumption of the war in Gaza, these claims will be seen as more evidence that Hamas must be utterly eradicated. The ceasefire is entering a new period of uncertainty, with the first phase drawing to an end - while negotiations on the next stage have yet to begin in earnest. The second phase - in which all the remaining hostages, alive or dead, are due to be released - has been seen from the start as potentially more challenging than the first one. Israel is demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas, while Hamas rejects the prospect of Israel continuing to maintain tight security control over Gaza. Any major breakdown in the deal could see a return to fighting. On the other side, though, is perhaps the majority of public opinion in Israel - that nothing should get in the way of all the remaining hostages being returned. In expressing his condemnation of the latest developments, Israel's President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel must remember what he called its ""highest duty - to do everything in our power to bring every one of our kidnapped sisters and brothers home"". The Hostages and Missing Families Forum echoed this, saying ""every step"" must be taken with ""careful responsibility"" to ensure the safe return of all hostages.

It happened in an area where the buses were parked in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday night. There were no casualties. Devices on two other buses failed to explode, police said. Local media reported that one of these carried a message referring to ""revenge"" for a recent Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli military to carry out ""an intensive operation against centres of terrorism"" in the West Bank in response. Footage on social media showed at least one bus on fire, with a large plume of smoke rising above. Speaking shortly after the explosions, police spokesperson Aryeh Doron urged the public to be on alert for ""every suspected bag or object"". ""We may be lucky if indeed the terrorists set these timers to the wrong hour. But it's too early to determine,"" he said on Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a separate televised briefing, police commander Haim Sargarof said the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those previously found in the West Bank, where Israel has been carrying out months of raids against militants, AFP news agency reported. According to local media, one of the unexploded mechanisms, weighing 5kg (11lbs), carried a message saying ""Revenge from Tulkarm"", an apparent reference to a recent Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in northern West Bank. Following the explosions, the Palestinian militant group Tulkarm Brigade released a statement that said ""Revenge for the martyrs will not be forgotten as long as the occupier sits on our land"", Israeli news site Haaretz reported. The statement did not claim responsibility for the attack.

,,,reliable,,"From her house in east London, British-Israeli Sharone Lifschitz never gave up hope that her 84-year-old father Oded would return from the horror of Hamas captivity, after more than 500 days. He was a man of peace, a campaigner for, and a friend of, Palestinians. He was dragged from his home by Palestinian gunmen on 7 October and killed in captivity after being taken to Gaza alive. The return of his body on Thursday was devastating news for Ms Lifschitz and her family, particularly her mother Yocheved who was also a hostage but returned alive and now will not be able to reunite with her husband of 63 years. After identifying Oded's body, the head of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine said he had been killed in captivity more than a year ago. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said he ""was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization."" The BBC were with Sharone, a filmmaker and academic, at her home when the ceasefire was announced last month. She shed tears of joy and hope as at last she saw an opportunity where she would discover what had happened to her father. After more than a year of him being held hostage, she didn't know if he was alive or dead. Sharone Lifschitz admitted then that at his age the hopes for his survival were slim, but she also believed ""miracles can happen"". Ms Lifschitz has been an eloquent and dignified voice for the release of her father and the other hostages, and shed light on the trauma the hostage families have faced since their ordeal began. ""One way or another, we will know. We will know if he's still with us, if we can look after him. We will know who we are grieving for… My father didn't deserve this. But she recognised there were ""more graves to come."" And now, one will be for her father. Oded Lifshitz was a journalist and veteran campaigner for peace who drove sick Palestinians to hospitals in Israel for treatment. In his campaign for Palestinian rights he met Yasser Arafat, then head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). He helped to found Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and was taken hostage from. It was a place where he was well-known for the cacti that he grew, the piano he played and the grandchildren he adored. In a tribute, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Oded's death, and sent his ""heartfelt condolences"" to his family. ""When I met Sharone in Downing Street, she showed remarkable strength in the face of the most difficult circumstances,"" Sir Keir said. ""The news of her father's death is a tragedy. It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved."" About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the 7 October attacks and 251 others, including Oded and Yocheved, taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As well as Oded, three other bodies were released by Hamas on Thursday - who Hamas said were Shiri Bibas, 33, and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir. But on Thursday night, Israel's military accused Hamas of handing over the body of an unidentified person instead of that of Ms Bibas. ""During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage,"" the Israel Defense Forces said. Oded's wife Yocheved, who was freed as a hostage by Hamas in 2023, met then-Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar while held in the tunnels under Gaza - and told him he should be ashamed of himself. The British lawyers supporting the family said ""Yocheved must be the only person to have met Sinwar, Netanyahu and the Pope, and given them all a piece of her mind.

,,,reliable,,"""The hearts of an entire nation lie in tatters,"" Israel's President Isaac Herzog has said, as the bodies of four hostages taken alive by Hamas in its attack on 7 October 2023 were returned to Tel Aviv. Hamas says the bodies are those of a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose unknown fate has gripped Israel. Israel has confirmed only the identity of the fourth - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination. President Herzog wrote ""there are no words"" in a post on social media platform X, asking the four for forgiveness ""for not bringing you home safely"". It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month. Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence. Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday. The news that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country. Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government never confirmed the claim. Addressing Israelis in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was ""united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head today.

,,,reliable,,"When Hanaa arrived at work a few months ago, she found ""drawers and doors smashed, and the boss surrounded by security personnel"". Computers, phones, cameras and documents were all confiscated, her boss was arrested and the organisation's bank account was eventually frozen. Hanaa works for a US-funded non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Yemen, that supports women's empowerment and trains people to solve problems through negotiation. But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous. Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months. A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody. The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse. Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK - to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country. It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article. By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted. ""When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies,"" she says. A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021. That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen. By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. ""For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying,"" she says. Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects. Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs. ""During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone,"" he says. Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. ""Each call was between five to 10 minutes,"" he explains. The BBC approached the Houthis to ask about their treatment of aid workers, but got no reply. In addition to the detentions, lifesaving assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been paused as a result of President Trump's freeze on the organisation's operations around the world, amid allegations of waste and misuse of funds. Human Rights Watch (HRW) warns that that the impact of President Trump's policies and the Houthis' arbitrary arrests is ""nothing short of devastating"". It ""will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen"", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation. According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN. ""Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us,"" warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families. Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home. Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began. Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything. ""If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing,"" Amal adds. About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world. Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice. ""I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless,"" Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. ""I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny,"" she says, her voice both anguished and bitter. A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available. At a clinic in northern Yemen, the shelves where medicines should be lie empty. Staff told us the medical stock they have is nothing compared to the people's needs. The BBC contacted the UN seeking comment on the current aid distribution process and recent arrests but received no reply. However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as ""not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy"". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs. It is for families like Amal's that Hanaa and her co-workers try to make life better. She proudly remembers how they sent girls to school in one of the conservative northern areas. When parents complained about neighbours being able to see their daughters during break time, ""we held discussions between residents, and eventually agreed to cover the playground, so that girls could go back to class"", she explains. She fears that the absence of this support, due to fear and lack of funds, could increase rates of illiteracy. ""We are the only ones who have survived during the collapse of the state, in order to serve the people,"" Hanaa says with a sigh.

Tuesday marked the end of the deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from the country, which was part of a truce that came into force in November and put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah. The agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, also stipulated the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from southern Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese soldiers to the area where the group has been the dominant force for decades. But a day earlier, the Israeli military announced its forces would remain at five ""strategic"" hilltops, until the Lebanese army fully implemented its part of the deal. It was not clear how long they would stay. In response to the announcement, Lebanon said Israel must withdraw completely. It said it would consider ""the continued Israeli presence in any inch of Lebanese territory an occupation"".

Returning in convoys, residents carried the yellow Hezbollah flag and posters with the face of the group's late leader Hassan Nasrallah. In Kfar Kila, right next to the border with Israel, no building had not been destroyed or heavily damaged. Families searched the rubble for personal items, but few could have been saved.

,,,reliable,,"It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it. For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery. According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn. Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces. The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025. The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited. The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition. From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements. Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history. Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed. On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition. The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution. Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum. It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene. The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition. But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini. Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil. After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend. It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami. Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran. Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world. Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it ""one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West"". The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion. Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period. And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882. But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says. Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget.

American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29, were freed in return for 369 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. So far 19 hostages and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in the first phase of ceasefire deal which began on 19 January. The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel. Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said ""intense"" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"". But on Saturday the sixth swap went ahead, with the hostages handed over to Red Cross workers in a highly-choreographed public show in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. Surrounded by heavily armed Hamas militants, the men briefly addressed a crowd of Palestinians before being transferred into Red Cross vehicles. They did not look as gaunt as the hostages freed a week earlier - their appearance had aroused anger in Israel and elsewhere. Under the first six-week stage of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are supposed to be freed. The three men were airlifted by military helicopters to a hospital in central Israel, where they underwent medical tests and were reunited with relatives. Yair Horn and his brother Eitan, 37, had been abducted from a kibbutz during the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. Eitan remains in captivity in Gaza. Pictures showed Yair Horn hugging his mother and his brother Amos in hospital, and a message where he wrote ""Eitan, you're next"". US citizen Sagui Dekel-Chen also reunited with his wife, where he learned that he had one-year-old daughter. His wife had been eight months pregnant with their third child when he was captured by Hamas in October 2023. US President Donald Trump marked the hostage release on Saturday, noting Hamas had not followed through with their threat. ""They seem to be in good shape,"" he said. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, posting on social media, said the hostages had been ""forced to endure"" a ""despicable and cynical ceremony"". In a social media post, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to work with the US to ""ensure that all hostages return to Israel soon"". The majority of the freed Palestinians were taken to Gaza, although some were taken to the West Bank. In both areas, crowds gathered to welcome the former prisoners.

""They all have chronic illnesses,"" said Mohammad Faqih, an official from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, adding that one man had a broken leg. Most of the 36 Palestinians serving life sentences will reportedly be deported to Egypt. The latest releases mean that under the ceasefire, Hamas is due to free another 14 hostages. However Israel says eight are of them are dead, meaning six living Israelis are still expected to be returned in the first phase. A total of 141 hostages have now been freed, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals released as part of a previous deal between Israel and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.

The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement that the convoy was taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport when it was targeted and one of its vehicles set on fire. Protesters have been blocking the road to the airport following a decision by the Lebanese government to bar two Iranian planes from landing.

,,,reliable,,"Hamas has released the names of three hostages due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, after days of fears over the future of the ceasefire. They are Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, Argentine-Israeli Yair Horn, and US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen. Israel has said it will resume bombing if the three are not released on time. The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. President Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday. Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel. The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. More than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza. There are also three other Israeli hostages - one of whom is dead - who have been held in Gaza for a decade or more. Alexander Troufanov, 29, Yair Horn, 46, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, were all seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz on the edge of Gaza. The ceasefire has been under strain since it began, with each side taking reciprocal action over alleged violations. Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing. Israel has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes. For its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this. Meanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza. A source in the Hamas-run police said the rocket was an unexploded Israeli ordinance that had fired into the air while it was being moved away, Reuters news agency reported.

,,,reliable,,"In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home. In the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire. Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza. But now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to ""a parcel of land"" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat. Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check. ""We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!"" says Abdo, a civil engineer. ""The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them. This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence."" Others stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt. To try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz. He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally. Egypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East. Since Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally. Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty. Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance. However, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism. American military aid ""does not constitute any value to Egypt,"" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said. He insisted Egyptians refuse ""pressure"" or ""blackmail"". Egypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans. Egyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled. Egypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive. The hope now is that by devising its own ""masterplan"" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy. The Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (£16bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away.",,,,Gaza plans put Egypt-US relations to tough test,"Yolande Knell in Jerusalem and Wael Hussein in Cairo, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts with Israel. It has strong backing from Iran and opposes Israel's right to exist. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and many other nations, including the UK and US. The latest Hezbollah-Israel conflict erupted in October 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets over the frontier after the start of the Gaza war, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israel responded with strikes. The conflict escalated further in September 2024, when Israel said it wanted tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by Hezbollah rocket attacks to be able to safely return. It began a campaign of wide-ranging air strikes against Hezbollah, followed by a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The conflict has left Hezbollah severely weakened. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon, including many civilians. More than a million people have been displaced in Lebanon since 8 October 2023. Israel says 45 Israeli civilians and 75 soldiers were killed in the conflict to November 2024. A ceasefire agreement announced on 27 November requires both Hezbollah and Israeli forces to leave southern Lebanon. The initial deadline of 26 January was extended until 18 February. Hezbollah emerged out of Shia militias formed to resist Israel after its invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982, during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. Its name means ""Party of God"" in Arabic. Officially announcing its existence in 1985, Hezbollah called for an Islamic government in Lebanon. It declared that its confrontation with Israel ""should only end when it has been removed from existence"". The group's attacks on Israeli forces are widely considered in Lebanon to have been instrumental in Israel's decision to end its 18-year-long occupation in 2000. The date Israeli forces left is a public holiday in Lebanon, called Resistance and Liberation Day. Afterwards, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and maintained a significant military presence in the south of Lebanon. The group, and the Lebanese government, refused to accept the UN's finding that the Israeli withdrawal was complete, saying disputed border areas were still occupied. Sporadic exchanges of fire with Israeli forces continued. In July 2006, Hezbollah fighters launched a deadly cross-border attack, triggering a massive Israeli response. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day war, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians. The next month, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1701, which ended the war and created a buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon. The current ceasefire deal also uses this agreement as its basis. It demanded that non-state armed groups in Lebanon disarm and pull back about 30km (19 miles) north of the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel, in line with the Litani River. It said this area ""should be free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Lebanese authorities and UN peacekeepers"". However, Hezbollah, which had declared victory, did not comply and went on to build extensive infrastructure in the area. Lebanon says Israel's violations of the resolution have included military flights over its territory. Hezbollah also continued to upgrade and expand its arsenal. With Iranian funding, training and weapons, its forces became stronger than those of the Lebanese army. In 2009, the group issued a new political manifesto in which it dropped the reference to an Islamic government but rejected ""any compromise with Israel or recognising its legitimacy"". Its fighters also became battle-hardened in neighbouring Syria's civil war. By 2013, they were helping then-President Bashar al-Assad's government turn the tide against rebel and jihadist forces. Hezbollah has also been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets outside Lebanon. Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were killed during the latest conflict with Israel. Hezbollah was led by Hassan Nasrallah, a Shia cleric, from 1992 until his death in an Israeli air strike in September 2024. Nasrallah had played a key role in turning Hezbollah into a political force, as well as a military one. He was revered by Hezbollah supporters and had close links with Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Despite being one of the best known and most influential figures in the Middle East, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for many years, to avoid being targeted by Israel. Following his death, Hezbollah announced in late October that its deputy secretary general Naim Qassem would become its new leader. Other senior figures killed in Israeli attacks include cleric Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to replace Nasrallah. Hezbollah's current military strength is difficult to assess as it has suffered heavy losses. Before the ceasefire was announced in November, much of its infrastructure was destroyed, its weapons arsenal was depleted and hundreds of fighters killed. The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria is also seen as a significant blow to Hezbollah. Syria, under Assad, played an important role in Hezbollah's connections to Iran and it was a key staging post for the transfer of weapons and ammunition to the group. Previously, Hezbollah had been considered one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world. In 2021, the group claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates put the number between 20,000 and 50,000. Before the conflict with Israel escalated, it was estimated to have 120,000-200,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Most of this arsenal was made up of small, unguided, surface-to-surface artillery rockets. It was also thought to have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. The war with Israel has also led to a political shift in Lebanon. A new president, Joseph Aoun, was appointed in January 2025, after the country spent more than two years without one. Aoun was the head of Lebanon's army and he was selected despite Hezbollah preferring another candidate. He has pledged to work to ensure that the Lebanese state has ""the exclusive right to bear arms"" - a direct reference to Hezbollah. In addition, a post-war cabinet named by the new prime minister, Nawaf Salam, excludes Hezbollah. However, it is split evenly among Lebanon's religious groups and Hezbollah's ally, Amal, was allowed to choose four ministers. New US Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus has warned that the Trump administration has ""clear red lines"" that Hezbollah will not be tolerated as a part of the government. Before the war, Hezbollah - along with other political groups - was already constrained by Lebanon's many problems, including one of the world's worst economic crises and political corruption. No group ran the country and there had been no functioning government since elections in 2022. However, although the country was deeply divided over Hezbollah, it had considerable influence, with a seat in every previous cabinet formed since 2005 and a network of social services including schools and healthcare facilities. It also enjoyed substantial popular support from those who saw it as a resistance force against Israel. In a country where religious identity strongly impacts people's politics, many of Hezbollah's supporters have traditionally been Shia Muslims, while many of its critics and opponents are non-Shia.",,,,What is Hezbollah and why has it been fighting Israel in Lebanon?,No author available,,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Parents of four young female Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza have told the BBC about how their daughters were abused, including being starved, intimidated and threatened by armed men, and forced to cook and clean. They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death. They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary. None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk.

It did not name them but published a photograph of them with their faces blurred, meeting the British ambassador, Hugo Shorter, at the prosecutor's office in Kerman on Wednesday. The Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Iran, saying that British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk"" of arrest, questioning or detention. ""Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you,"" the advice says. Also at the meeting between the Britons and the UK ambassador were Kerman's prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and the deputy governor general for security and law enforcement affairs Rahman Jalali, state news agency IRNA reported. Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.

,,,reliable,,"Israel is seeking another extension of the deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon, a Western diplomatic source says, a request that is likely to raise new concerns in a country with a history of Israeli occupation. Israeli forces had been due to pull out next week but the source told the BBC Israel wanted its military to stay in five positions there for another 10 days, till 28 February. The ceasefire deal that ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was brokered by the US and France and came into force on 27 November. It requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from there too. At the same time, thousands of Lebanese soldiers were expected to be deployed to the region where, for decades, Hezbollah has been the dominant force. The ceasefire has already been extended once - the initial deadline was 26 January - after Israel said the Lebanese state had not fully implemented the deal. Lebanon accused Israel of delaying its withdrawal. One of the priorities of the new Lebanese government is to restore the country's territorial sovereignty, and the authorities strongly reject another delay. President Joseph Aoun insisted on Wednesday that there was ""no truth"" to reports that another extension had been agreed, his office said. He also ""repeatedly stressed Lebanon's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops"" by Tuesday. The continued presence of Israeli troops is a source of concern for many in Lebanon as Israel occupied the country's south for 18 years, between 1982 and 2000. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to target Hezbollah, and has vowed to carry out more attacks on the Iran-backed group to stop it from rearming or rebuilding its forces. On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier at low altitude over the capital Beirut for the first time since the ceasefire began. Hezbollah, which is a militant, political and social movement, was severely weakened in the conflict with Israel, although it continues to enjoy significant support among Shia Muslims in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was widely considered as a surrender by the group, after it saw its infrastructure and weapons arsenal depleted, and hundreds of fighters and key figures killed, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. The conflict escalated last September, when Israel launched an intense air campaign across Lebanon, assassinated Hezbollah's senior leaders and invaded southern Lebanon. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents, Lebanese authorities say. It also caused billions of dollars in destruction and damage. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's rocket, mortar and drone attacks, and to remove its weapons and infrastructure from areas along the border. Hezbollah had launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",,,,"Israel seeks another extension for Lebanon withdrawal, source says","Hugo Bachega, Middle East correspondent, Reporting fromBeirut",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"A World Food Programme (WFP) worker has died while in detention in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen, according to the UN agency. The WFP said the man was one of seven Yemeni staff ""arbitrarily detained"" by local authorities since 23 January. It is unclear when or how he died. His death was announced a day after the UN said it would be pausing all operations in the northern governorate of Saada, a stronghold of the Iran-backed Houthi movement, over safety concerns. The UN said it followed the detention by the Houthis of eight additional UN personnel, including six in Saada. More than 60 staff from the UN, international non-governmental organisations and foreign embassies were already being held. ""This extraordinary and temporary measure seeks to balance the imperative to stay and deliver with the need to have the safety and security of the UN personnel and its partners guaranteed,"" UN spokesman Farhan Haq said. In a post on X on Tuesday, WFP executive director Cindy McCain said the worker who died in detention was named Ahmed and that he was a ""devoted humanitarian and father of 2"" who had helped deliver life-saving food assistance. According to the WFP, he had been working for the agency since 2017. McCain said she was ""heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss"". ""Humanitarians are #NotATarget,"" she added. There was no immediate comment from Houthi authorities. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US and UK intervened in an effort to restore its rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid. Last month, the UN said it was actively engaging with senior Houthi officials to try to secure the release of all its detained employees. Even though they provide a vital lifeline, UN agencies have regularly had problems reaching people in more remote areas outside the major towns and cities, with Houthi officials regularly reported to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Human rights groups have also accused the movement of kidnapping, torturing and arbitrarily detaining hundreds of civilians. In June, the Houthis claimed they had dismantled an ""American-Israeli spy network"" following the detention of 13 UN staff, as well as more than 50 NGO workers and an embassy staff member.

,,,reliable,,"The Israeli military has said an elderly Israeli man was killed during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and that his body is being held hostage in Gaza. Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour, 86, was abducted by gunmen at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim. His wife, Mazal, managed to escape. The military said the decision to confirm Shlomo's death was based on intelligence gathered in recent months and was approved by an expert committee of the ministry of health. His name is on the Israeli government's list of 33 hostages to be released by Hamas during the first phase of a ceasefire deal that is coming under growing strain. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails since 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages. The remaining 17 Israeli hostages - two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50 - are supposed to be released over the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of those hostages are dead but not named them. On Monday, Hamas warned that it would postpone the scheduled release of the next group of three this weekend unless US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators addressed what it said were Israeli violations of the deal, including delays in allowing in shelters and medical supplies. The threat prompted US President Donald Trump to propose that Israel cancel the deal and ""let hell break out"" if Hamas did not release all the hostages by midday on Saturday. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas's move was a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and told the Israeli military to prepare for any possible scenario in Gaza. Shlomo Mansour was born in Baghdad and as a child survived the Farhud pogrom against the Iraqi capital's Jewish community in 1941. He emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 13 and went on to help found Kibbutz Kissufim, where he worked in the chicken coop and eyewear factory. On 7 October 2023, hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen stormed the Israel's Gaza perimeter fence and attacked many nearby Israeli communities, including Kissufim. They killed about 1,200 people were killed and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Shlomo and Mazal - who had five children and 12 grandchildren - fled to their home's safe room that day, but a group of gunmen fired at the door and were able to break it open. Mazal hid in the bathroom, but they found Shlomo, handcuffed him, and took him out of the house. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had informed the Mansour family that he was then murdered by the gunmen and that they took his body back to Gaza as a hostage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife, Sara, sent their heartfelt condolences to the family following the ""bitter news"". ""We will neither rest nor be silent until he is returned for burial in Israel,"" he added. ""We will continue to take determined and relentless action until we return all of our hostages - the living and the deceased.""",,,,"Elderly hostage in Gaza was killed in 7 October attack, Israel says","David Gritten, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Why has Hamas announced a delay just days before it is due to release the next group of hostages? In one of its official statements, released on Telegram, the group called its announcement a ""warning"" to Israel and said it was giving mediators ""ample time to pressure the occupation [Israel] into fulfilling its obligations"". It said the ""door remains open"" for the next scheduled releases to go ahead on Saturday. The group appears to be giving time for the impasse to be resolved. But what exactly is the impasse? Hamas lists a series of complaints, from delaying the return of displaced people, continuing to open fire on them and failing to allow the entry of certain types of humanitarian aid. Other Palestinian officials not connected with Hamas have cited Israel's reluctance to allow caravans into Gaza to house the vast numbers of Palestinians whose homes have been destroyed. At a time when the Israeli government is openly discussing ways to encourage civilians to leave Gaza, the failure to give permits for badly needed temporary accommodation is bound to stoke Palestinian fears of expulsion. Fears exacerbated, almost every day, by Donald Trump. What began as an apparently off-the-cuff suggestion that most Palestinians should leave while the Gaza Strip is rebuilt has morphed into the president's demand that all should leave and that the US should take over and run Gaza. As Trump continues to double down on his incendiary suggestion, Hamas may be wondering whether it's worth engaging in phase two of the ceasefire talks. What exactly are the talks for? If Trump is serious, the Palestinians know that it will fall to Israel to make sure that Gaza is devoid of civilians. Depriving them of shelter won't be enough. It will almost certainly require force. Now Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday he will propose cancelling the ceasefire and ""all hell"" will break out. But he did say he was speaking for himself and ""Israel can override it"". Faced with the possible resumption of war, Hamas may be wondering what incentive there is to release the remaining hostages. For relatives and friends of the hostages, the current impasse, and Trump's noisy intervention, is cause for fresh anxiety. ""Each of these statements or announcements, of course, make Hamas more stubborn,"" Dudi Zalmanovich told the BBC. His wife's nephew, Omer Shem Tov, is still being held by Hamas. ""I would prefer him to be less proactive,"" Mr Zalmanovich said of Trump. Israel has its own suspicions about the rationale behind Hamas's threatened delay. The spectacle of emaciated hostages being released at the weekend has raised fears that Hamas may not want the world to see others in even worse condition. On top of the televised scenes of well-armed Hamas fighters parading in broad daylight, and warnings from the former US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that the group has recruited as many soldiers as it's lost during the war, not all Israelis believe the ceasefire can – or even should – hold. It's too early to say whether this carefully negotiated, staged process is about to collapse – as many have predicted it will – but after a mostly positive start, it's under increasing strain.",,,,Paul Adams: Why the Gaza ceasefire is under growing strain,"Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"An Israeli police raid on a well-known chain of Palestinian bookshops in occupied East Jerusalem and the detention of their owners has shocked many people in the city's cultural, journalistic and diplomatic communities, who have described it as heavy handed and unjustified. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew, Ahmad, have been detained since Sunday on broad charges of disrupting public order. Their lawyer, Nasser Odeh, said they had been kept overnight in freezing conditions. An application to further detain them under house arrest and ban them from their Educational Bookshop stores was also made by police, Mr Odeh said. The men run three bookshops which are popular with tourists, journalists and diplomats. They specialise in books, newspapers and comics about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Middle Eastern history and culture. Between them, the three shops have hundreds of publications in several languages and are a focal point of the city's cultural scene. But, according to the men's families, on Sunday afternoon, plain clothes police raided two of the shops on Salah ad-Din Street, without warning. Using online translating applications, they removed any books with the words ""Palestine"" or ""Palestinian"" in the title, as well as publications showing the red, green and white Palestinian flag. Among the publications seized were recently released books on the conflict in Gaza as well as books featuring work by the artist Banksy and a children's colouring book about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. An Israeli police statement said the two men were arrested on suspicion of ""selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism"". The statement said that police would ""continue their efforts to thwart incitement and support for terrorism, as well as apprehend those involved in offences that threaten the security of Israel's citizens"". That justification for raiding the bookstores and arresting their owners has been roundly condemned by their supporters and customers as another disturbing assault on Palestinian cultural institutions, after previous actions against theatres and educational facilities.",,,,Anger over Israel's arrest of East Jerusalem bookshop owners,"Wyre Davies, BBC News, Jerusalem•@WyreDavies, •",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south. Hundreds of Palestinians in cars and on carts laden with mattresses and other goods began returning to northern Gaza following the pull-out - often to scenes of utter destruction. The Israeli withdrawal is in line with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement of 19 January under which 16 Israeli hostages and 566 Palestinian prisoners have so far been freed. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the Gaza war. At least 48,189 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says. On Sunday, crowds of Palestinians were seen traversing the Netzarim Corridor - mostly moving north to see what had happened to their abandoned homes. ""What we saw was a catastrophe, horrific destruction. The [Israeli] occupation destroyed all the homes, shops, farms, mosques, universities and the courthouse,"" Osama Abu Kamil, a resident of al-Maghraqa just north of Netzarim, told the AFP news agency. The 57-year-old, who had been forced to live for more than a year in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, said he now planned to ""set up a tent for me and my family next to the rubble of our house"". ""We have no choice,"" he added. Mahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him ""arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning"". He said this was ""the first time I saw our destroyed house"", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area. ""The entire area is in ruins. I cannot live here,"" he added. About 700,000 residents of northern Gaza fled to southern areas at the start of the war, when the Israeli military issued mass evacuation orders before launching a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory. Many of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too. They were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea. Israeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza. Those on vehicles have to use Salah al-Din Street and undergo screening for weapons by US and Egyptian security contractors. The Israel Defense Forces have not officially commented on Sunday's withdrawal from the eastern part of the corridor, which will leave it in control of Gaza's borders, but not the road that had cut it in half. The Haaretz newspaper says the Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry has been urging people to ""exercise caution and adhere to the existing movement guidelines for their safety"". The troop withdrawal comes as an Israeli delegation is expected to fly to Qatar which has been moderating talks between the two sides in the Gaza war. The Israeli government has previously said the delegation will initially discuss ""technical matters"" regarding the first phase of the ceasefire deal, rather than the more challenging second phase which is meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of all remaining living hostages in Gaza for more Palestinian prisoners and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. That will require further direction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently became the first foreign leader to meet US President Donald Trump since his return to the White House. During the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called ""The Riviera of the Middle East"". Convening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a ""completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel"". ""A revolutionary, creative vision - and we are discussing it,"" he was quoted as saying in an official readout of the meeting. ""He [Trump] is very determined to carry it out. It also opens up many possibilities for us."" Trump's proposal, which would be a crime under international law, has been almost universally rejected, including by Arab states. The Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept ""any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement,"" accusing Israel of ""ethnic cleansing"". Egypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called ""serious"" Palestinian developments.",,,,Israel troops withdraw from corridor that split Gaza in two,"Joe Inwood, BBC News, Reporting fromJerusalem, Paulin Kola, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"The sight of Eli Sharabi being interviewed on stage, surrounded by Hamas fighters, has caused heartbreak and fury in equal measure amongst Israelis. ""How do you feel?"" he is asked by a masked interviewer. ""I feel very happy today to return to... my wife and daughters"", he answers, seemingly unaware they were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The scene was broadcast live around the world, the stage-managed handover of hostages, to send a message. The ranks of armed fighters, the banner in Arabic, Hebrew and English declaring ""We are the flood... the war's next day"" - all filmed on modern camera equipment - says to the world they are still in charge in the Gaza Strip and intend to remain so. In previous exchanges, Hamas have also sought to give the impression that they had taken good care of those they had kidnapped. It was not possible this time. All three men looked gaunt and sunken-eyed. As their images were broadcast into Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, the mood changed from one of celebration to anguish. ""It's complicated,"" said 21-year-old Ruth Senderovich, who was watching on the big screens. ""It's the greatest joy that I've had in a while, and it's also devastating because you see men that were leaders of the family, they were fathers, and now you see broken men."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel ""will not gloss over the shocking scenes"", and that action would be taken accordingly, without specifying what that would be. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which facilitates the transfers, said it was ""increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations"" - calling for them to be ""dignified and private"". But it is not only Hamas who have come under fierce criticism for the condition of the people they have been releasing. Shortly after the three hostages were freed, 183 Palestinians - some serving long sentences for their part in the killings of Israelis, others held without charge - left Israeli jails. One of those being released was Jamal al-Tawil, the former mayor of al-Bireh. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Recently he had been on hunger strike to protest against his detention without charge. His daughter, who was herself recently released from prison, claimed that he was beaten in the final moments before his release. He had to be carried from the bus to the hospital while connected to a ventilator. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, seven of those being released from Israeli jails needed hospital treatment following their imprisonment. There have been numerous reports since 7 October 2023, accusing the Israeli authorities of abusing Palestinian prisoners. The question now is what impact, if any, Saturday's releases will have on the fragile ceasefire deal. Israel has said it is sending negotiators to Qatar to discuss ""technical issues"", before they begin talks around the next phase. It has also warmly welcomed the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza would be emptied of Palestinians. Hamas, meanwhile, has accused Israel of a ""lack of commitment"" regarding the ceasefire, but said that the group is still ready to join any talks. Hamas also released a slickly produced video of the release of the three hostages. Filmed in underground tunnels, apparently learning they are to be released. They speak to the camera, thanking God and then putting on uniforms with their own photos on them. The release of the video was soon followed by a statement from the families asking for it not to be broadcast. For all the anger about the condition of those being held, there was another conclusion that many have drawn from today. A deal to secure their freedom - and a permanent end to the fighting - cannot come soon enough.

,,,reliable,,"Hamas has freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, while Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange as part of an internationally brokered ceasefire deal. The three hostages - Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy - were handed over to the Red Cross on Saturday morning before reuniting with their families in Israel. Concerns have been raised about their wellbeing, with Mr Sharabi's family - who live in the UK - describing their shock at his ""gaunt"" appearance. Returning Palestinian prisoners were greeted with scenes of celebration at Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Representatives claimed they all needed ""medical care"", without giving specifics. So far, 16 Israeli hostages and 566 prisoners have been freed since the ceasefire began on 19 January. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Five Thai hostages have also been released during this period following a separate agreement. As Mr Sharabi, Mr Ben Ami and Mr Levy were handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, crowds lined up, cordoned off by a row of armed fighters, to watch and film on mobile phones, as Hamas and Palestinian flags flew. A Hamas official and Red Cross representative signed paperwork on a stage to complete the handover. The hostages were then paraded on stage, flanked by men with guns. The three men posed holding certificates and answered questions into a microphone, before waving as they were ushered into Red Cross vehicles. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed horror at the physical state of the men who he said were ""returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also criticised the men's state, saying ""we have seen again what the monsters of Hamas are"". He also accused Hamas of ""repeated violations"" of the ceasefire deal, without providing specifics. Speaking to BBC Arabic on Saturday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the latest release of Israeli hostages had been carried out in a ""civilised manner"". He also accused Israel of ""dragging its feet"" on implementing humanitarian relief agreed as part of the ceasefire. Netanyahu's co-ordinator of prisoners and missing persons said Israel treated the issues with ""great severity"" and would raise them with ceasefire mediators and take action. Mr Sharabi's brother-in-law, Steve Brisley, told the BBC that having confirmation he is alive is ""what we've been working toward for the last 16 months"".

,,,reliable,,"A Palestinian and an Israeli sit in a West Bank village at night. They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability. For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality. Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages. The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature. It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death. ""It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,"" Yuval told the BBC. ""I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now."" Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years. Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against ""illegal construction"", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot. Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN. More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe. In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence – the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006. Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen. Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a ""title deed"" to the West Bank and ""there's no such thing"" as occupation or settlements. When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time. The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there. According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the ""expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert"". Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.

,,,reliable,,"An Israeli military court has sentenced a soldier to seven months in prison after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military detention centre. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reservist, who it did not name, was convicted over ""several incidents in which he punched the detainees with his fists and used his weapon while they were handcuffed and blindfolded"". ""These acts were committed in the presence of other soldiers, some of whom called on him to stop, and were even documented on the defendant's mobile phone,"" it added. The Haaretz newspaper said he was the first soldier convicted of abusing Gazans held during the war with Hamas. He had made the Palestinians say demeaning phrases and make animal noises, and beat them while they were bound and blindfolded, Haaretz reported. It also cited the Beit Lid Military Court as saying the soldier admitted to three counts of aggravated abuse and one count of unbecoming conduct as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. They related to four separate incidents between January and June 2024, when he was guarding lorries transporting detainees, it said. According to Haaretz, the court found an unspecified number of masked soldiers, whose identities remain unknown, had also participated in the abuse. In addition to the prison term, the convicted soldier was also given a suspended sentence and demoted to the rank of private, according to the IDF. ""Soldiers have a duty to use the force entrusted to them in accordance with IDF values and orders, at all times and in times of war in particular,"" the IDF said. The Sde Teiman detention facility was set up after the start of the Gaza war 15 months ago. Since then, it has been at the centre of reports of serious abuses. In July, far-right protesters broke into Sde Teiman after Israeli military police went there to question nine reservists suspected of raping a detainee and causing a life-threatening injury to him. Several of the reservists were subsequently arrested. In October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been ""subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence"". Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was ""fully committed to international legal standards"". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

,,,reliable,,"US President Donald Trump has restated a vision in which the US would take over Gaza, after officials in his administration appeared to contradict his earlier comments. ""The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,"" Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed. Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen. After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary. Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans ""would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region"". The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said. His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return. Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that any displacement would be temporary. In his own comments, made on the same day, Secretary of State Rubio said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an ""interim"" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place. These views contradicted Trump's initial comments on the matter. Speaking on Tuesday, when he proposed the development of Gaza into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"", Trump suggested that the displacement of Palestinians would be permanent. ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,"" he said on Tuesday during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the idea ""worth paying attention to"". The announcement took even senior Trump aides by surprise due to a lack of planning around the idea, the New York Times reported, citing four anonymous sources with knowledge of the discussions. Trump's fresh comment on Thursday that no American soldiers would be needed was more clearly in agreement with Leavitt, who said the US had not committed to putting ""boots on the ground"". Speaking soon after at a prayer breakfast, the president reflected briefly on the situation in Gaza, but did not mention his stated plans for the US to ""take over"" the territory. After turning his attention to the Middle East, Trump said he hoped ""his greatest legacy will be being known as a peacemaker and a unifier"". Fifteen months of fighting have left the Gaza Strip, a territory 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (6 miles) wide, largely uninhabitable. Entire districts have been razed to the ground. Agricultural land where greenhouses once stood has been reduced to sand and rubble. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that it could take 21 years to remove and dispose of all debris. It described the water and sanitation systems as ""almost entirely defunct"", warned of mounting rubbish around camps and shelters, and highlighted the risk that chemicals from destroyed solar panels and the munitions being used could contaminate soil and water supplies. More than 50 million tonnes of debris have accumulated as a result of the destruction, according to the UN body.

,,,reliable,,"Historic buildings in Mosul, including churches and mosques, are being reopened following years of devastation resulting from the Iraqi city's takeover by the extremist Islamic State (IS) group. The project, organised and funded by Unesco, began a year after IS was defeated and driven out of the city, in northern Iraq, in 2017. Unesco's director-general Audrey Azoulay attended a ceremony on Wednesday to mark the reopening. Local artisans, residents and representatives of all of Mosul's religious communities were also there. In 2014, IS occupied Mosul, which for centuries was seen as a symbol of tolerance and co-existence between different religious and ethnic communities in Iraq. The group imposed its extreme ideology on the city, targeting minorities and killing opponents. Three years later, a US-backed coalition in alliance with the Iraqi army and state-linked militias mounted an intense ground and air offensive to wrest the city back from IS control. The bloodiest battles focused on the Old City, where the group's fighters made a last stand. Mosul photographer Ali al-Baroodi recalls the horror that greeted him when he first entered the area shortly after the street-by-street battle was over in the summer of 2017. He saw the gloriously skewed al-Hadba minaret, known as the ""hunchback"", which had been emblematic of Mosul for hundreds of years, in ruins. ""It was like a ghost town,"" he says. ""Dead bodies all around, a sickening smell and horrible scenes of the city and the skyline without the Hadba minaret. ""It was not the city that we knew - it was like a metamorphosis - that we never imagined not even in our worst nightmares. I fell silent after that for a couple of days. I lost my voice. I lost my mind."" Eighty per cent of the Old City of Mosul, on the west bank of the Tigris, was destroyed during IS's three-year occupation. It was not just the churches, mosques and old houses that needed to be repaired, but also the community spirit of those who had lived there for so long in relative harmony between religions and ethnicities. The huge task of rebuilding began under the auspices of Unesco with a budget of $115m (£93m) that the agency had managed to drum up, much of it from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union. Father Olivier Poquillon - a Dominican priest - returned to Mosul to help oversee the restoration of one of the key buildings, the convent of Notre-Dame de l'Heure, known locally as al-Saa'a, which was founded nearly 200 years ago. ""We started by trying first to gather the team - a team composed of people from Old Mosul from different denominations - Christians, Muslims working all together,"" he says. Father Poquillon says that bringing the communities together was the biggest challenge and the biggest achievement. ""If you want to rebuild the buildings you've got first to rebuild trust - if you don't rebuild trust, it's useless to reconstruct the walls of those buildings because they will become a target for other communities."" In charge of the entire project - which included the restoration of 124 old houses and two especially fine mansions - has been the chief architect Maria Rita Acetoso, who came to Mosul straight from restoration work for Unesco in Afghanistan. ""This project demonstrates that culture too can create jobs, can encourage skills development and in addition can make those involved feel part of something meaningful,"" she says. She hopes the reconstruction can restore hope and enable the recovery of people's cultural identity and memory. ""I think this is particularly important for the young generations growing up in a situation of conflict and political instability,"" she adds. Unesco says that more than 1,300 local young people have been trained up in traditional skills, while some 6,000 new jobs have been created. More than 100 classrooms were renovated in Mosul. Thousands of historical fragments were recovered and catalogued from the rubble. Among the host of engineers involved in the rebuilding, 30% were women. Eight years on, the bells are ringing out again across Mosul from al-Tahera Church, whose roof collapsed after serious damage under IS occupation in 2017. Other major landmarks of Mosul have also been restored - that wriggling minaret of al-Hadba, the Dominican al-Saa'a Convent and the complex of Al-Nouri mosque. And people have been able to return to the houses that have been home to their families for centuries.",,,,Mosul's landmarks rise again after IS destruction,"Sebastian Usher, BBC's Middle East analyst",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Israel's defence minister has told its military to prepare a plan to ""allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so"", in line with President Donald Trump's proposal for the US to take over the territory and resettle its 2.1 million Palestinians elsewhere. Israel Katz said Gazans should have ""freedom of movement and migration"" and countries critical of Israel's war with Hamas were ""obligated"" to take them in. Israel controls the movement of people into and out of Gaza. Trump meanwhile said Gaza would be ""turned over"" to the US by Israel ""at the conclusion of fighting"". But the Palestinian presidency reiterated its rejection of the plan, which it has said would violate international law, and insisted that ""Palestine... is not for sale"". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed and 111,600 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times and almost 70% of its buildings are estimated to be destroyed or damaged. Healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter. The Israeli defence minister wrote on X on Thursday that he welcomed the US president's ""bold initiative"", saying it could ""support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas"". Katz announced that he had instructed the Israeli military to ""prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so, to any country willing to receive them"". ""The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air,"" he said. ""Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse."" He alleged that Hamas was preventing people leaving Gaza and said that they should have ""the right to freedom of movement and migration"". Hamas official Basem Naim accused Katz of trying to cover up for ""a state that has failed to achieve any of its objectives in the war on Gaza"" and said Palestinians would refuse to leave. Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Palestinian presidency asserted that ""Palestine, with its land, history and holy sites, is not for sale"". Nabil Abu Rudeineh also said the Palestinians would ""will not give up an inch of their land"", whether in Gaza or the occupied West Bank. ""The Palestinian people and their leadership will not allow the repetition of the catastrophes of 1948 and 1967, and will thwart any plan aimed at liquidating their just cause through investment projects whose place is neither in Palestine nor on its land."" The 1948 ""Nakba"", which means ""catastrophe"" in Arabic, saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flee or driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel. Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war along with Gaza, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN. Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year. On Wednesday, Jordan's king expressed its ""rejection of any attempts to annex land or displace Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank"", while Egypt's foreign minister stressed the importance of reconstruction ""without the Palestinians leaving the Gaza Strip"". Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries - said Trump's plan was ""absurd"" and would ""only put oil on the fire"" in the region. The UN human rights office warned that any forcible transfer in, or deportation of, people from occupied territory was strictly prohibited under international law. The UN's secretary general also said it was ""essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing"" and stressed that Gaza would be an integral part of a future Palestinian state. Antonio Guterres told a meeting in New York that the world had ""seen a chilling, systematic dehumanisation and demonization of an entire people"". Trump unveiled his plan for the US to take ""long-term ownership"" of Gaza and oversee its reconstruction during a visit to the White House by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. The president said most of the Palestinians living in Gaza would have to be relocated to achieve his vision of creating ""the Riviera of the Middle East"", and that they would be housed in Jordan, Egypt and other countries. ""I hope we can do something where they wouldn't want to go back,"" he said, echoing earlier remarks in the Oval Office where he talked about resettling people ""permanently"". At the White House briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt was asked to confirm whether all Palestinians who wanted to stay in Gaza would be allowed to do so. ""I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because... it is a demolition site,"" she replied, appearing to contradict the president. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an ""interim"" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place. On Thursday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Gaza would ""be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting"". A ceasefire in effect between Israel and Hamas has halted the war and aims to lead to a permanent end to the fighting. ""The Palestinians... would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free,"" he added. The president also said no US soldiers would be needed to maintain stability.

,,,reliable,,"Donald Trump's plan for the US to ""take over"" and ""own"" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, is not going to happen. It requires the co-operation of Arab states that have rejected it. They include Jordan and Egypt - countries that Trump wants to take in Gaza's Palestinians - and Saudi Arabia, which might be expected to foot the bill. Western allies of the US and Israel are also against the idea. Some - perhaps many - Palestinians in Gaza might be tempted to get out if they had the chance. But even if a million left, as many as 1.2m others would still be there. Presumably the United States - the new owners of Trump's ""Riviera of the Middle East"" - would have to use force to remove them. After America's catastrophic intervention in Iraq in 2003, that would be deeply unpopular in the US. It would be the final end of any lingering hope that a two-state solution was possible. That is the aspiration that a conflict more than a century old could be ended with the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel. The Netanyahu government is adamantly against the idea, and over years of failed peace talks, ""two states for two peoples"" became an empty slogan. But it has been a central plank of US foreign policy since the early 1990s. The Trump plan would also violate international law. America's already threadbare assertions that it believes in a rules-based international order would dissolve. Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine and China's in Taiwan would be turbocharged. Why worry about all that if it is not about to happen - at least not in the way Trump announced in Washington, watched by a grinning and clearly delighted Benjamin Netanyahu? The answer is that Trump's remarks, however outlandish, will have consequences. He is the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world - no longer a reality TV host and political hopeful trying to grab headlines. Short-term, the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. One senior Arab source told me it could be its ""death knell"". The absence of a plan for Gaza's future governance is already a fault line in the agreement. Now Trump has provided one, and even if it does not come to pass, it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis. It will nourish the plans and dreams of ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists who believe all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, and perhaps beyond, is a God-given Jewish possession. Their leaders are part of Netanyahu's government and keep him in power - and they're delighted. They want the Gaza war to resume with the longer-term objective of removing the Palestinians and replacing them with Jews. The finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said Trump had provided the answer to Gaza's future after the 7 October attacks. His statement said that ""whoever committed the most terrible massacre on our land will find himself losing his land forever. Now we will act to finally bury, with God's help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state."" Centrist opposition leaders in Israel have been less effusive, perhaps fearing trouble ahead, but have offered a polite welcome to the plan. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups may feel the need to answer Trump with some kind of show of force against Israel. For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe"". That was the exodus of Palestinians as Israel won its war for independence in 1948. More than 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces. All but a handful were never allowed back and Israel passed laws it still uses to confiscate their property. Now the fear will be that it is happening again. Many Palestinians already believed Israel was using the war against Hamas to destroy Gaza and expel the population. It is part of their accusation that Israel is committing genocide – and now they might believe Donald Trump is adding his weight to Israel's plans. Just because Trump says something, that does not make it true or certain. His statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than expressions of the settled policy of the United States. Perhaps Trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan. He is said to crave the Nobel peace prize. Middle East peacemakers, even when they do not ultimately succeed, have a strong track record of winning it. As the world was digesting his Gaza announcement, he posted on his Truth Social platform his desire for a ""verified nuclear peace agreement"" with Iran. The Iranian regime denies it wants nuclear weapons but there has been an open debate in Tehran about whether they are now so threatened that they need the ultimate deterrent. For many years Netanyahu has wanted the US, with Israeli help, to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. Doing a deal with Iran was never part of his plan. During Trump's first term, Netanyahu waged a long and successful campaign to persuade him to pull the US out of the nuclear deal Barack Obama's administration signed with Iran. If Trump wanted to throw the Israeli hard-right something to keep them happy as he makes overtures to the Iranians, he has succeeded. But he has also created uncertainty and injected more instability into the world's most turbulent region.",,,,"Jeremy Bowen: Trump's Gaza plan won't happen, but it will have consequences","Jeremy Bowen, International editor",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"For most Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip there is already a painful history of forced displacement that is at the heart of their response to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over the war-torn territory. Speaking to the BBC, residents of a tent camp in the central town of Deir al-Balah expressed shock and defiance at the idea of being permanently resettled outside. ""Even if it costs us our souls, we will not leave Gaza,"" said Mahmoud Bahjat, who is from the north. ""We are against Trump's decision. He ended the war but displacing us would end our lives."" On the other hand, many Israelis have been expressing satisfaction at the radical ideas from the White House, particularly those on the far-right who seek to resettle Gaza. Since a ceasefire took hold in Gaza - on the eve of Trump's inauguration last month - there have been dramatic scenes of Palestinians returning to what is left of their homes. Families have piled up possessions into cars and donkey carts or walked long distances along the coastal road, often just to reach piles of rubble. According to the UN, at least 1.9m people, or about 90% of the population, across Gaza became displaced during 15 months of war. The scenes of Palestinians on the move have echoed black-and-white footage from 1948 and the mass evacuations that took place during fighting before and after the creation of the state of Israel. More than 700,000 people were then forced from their homes. The majority of Gazans are descendants of those original refugees. Standing between rows of plastic sheeting in the Deir al-Balah camp, Jamalat Wadi says that her family has now sacrificed enough and that they are determined to build a new home. ""We endured a year and half of war. When [the Israeli military] finally withdraw from here, we want to remove the rubble and live on the land."" ""After the US made Israel destroy our houses in Gaza, he is telling us that Gaza is destroyed and we have to leave?"" Ms Wadi goes on. ""If there is only one drop of blood left in our children, we won't go out of Gaza. We won't give up on it!"" Many Palestinians we spoke to called on Jordan and Egypt - which Trump is pressing to take displaced Gazans - and for Saudi Arabia - which he wants to normalise relations with Israel - to hold out against US pressure. Since its establishment, Israel has rejected the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their historic homeland, as this would have left the Jewish people as a minority within its borders. Today, there are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN, with most living in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel has long argued that those who were dispossessed should be absorbed by Arab countries, pointing out that thousands of Jews left these to come to Israel during the regional turmoil after it became a state. Israeli officials suggest that by proposing to take over war-torn Gaza, creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" after resettling Palestinians elsewhere, the Trump administration is offering fresh thinking on a long-running conflict. While Trump notably did not back the re-establishment of settlements in Gaza, settler leaders have reacted enthusiastically to the idea of displacement, calling on the Israeli government to act immediately. Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory. ""Assuming Trump's declarations about transferring Gazans to other countries throughout the world actualise, we need to move quickly and build settlements throughout the Gaza Strip,"" stated the Nachala settlement organisation, which claims it has hundreds of activists ready to move there. ""No part of Israel should be left unsettled by Jews. If we leave any area desolate it is liable to be overtaken by our enemies,"" Nachala added. In contrast, the Israeli anti-occupation NGO, Peace Now, dismissed the Trump plan. It backs the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of the long-standing international formula for peace in the region, known as the two-state solution.

,,,reliable,,"When US President Donald Trump began speaking 10 days ago of Gaza as a demolition site, calling to ""clean out that whole thing"", it wasn't clear how far these were off-the-cuff remarks. But in the lead up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, in his Oval Office comments before the meeting, and in the press conference itself, it's now clear he is profoundly serious about his proposals. They amount to the most radical upending in the established US position on Israel and the Palestinians in the recent history of the conflict; and will be seen as flying in the face of international law. As well as how the announcement will be absorbed by ordinary people on the ground, it could also have a significant impact on the more immediate phased ceasefire and hostage release process, at a critical juncture. Trump and his officials are framing his call to - in his language - permanently ""resettle"" all Palestinians out of Gaza as a humanitarian gesture, saying there is no alternative for them because Gaza is a ""demolition site"". Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations are strictly prohibited, and Palestinians as well as Arab nations will see this as nothing short of a clear proposal aimed at their expulsion and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. That's why Arab leaders have already categorically rejected his ideas, made with increasing frequency over the last 10 days, when he suggested Egypt and Jordan could ""take"" Palestinians from Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said that such a move could ""threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples"". It has long been a desire of the ultranationalist far right in Israel to expel Palestinians from the occupied territories and expand Jewish settlements in their place. Since the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, these groups – leaders of whom have been part of Netanyahu's coalition – have demanded the war against Hamas continues indefinitely, vowing ultimately to re-establish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. They have continued their calls and opposed the current ceasefire and hostage release deal. In his White House press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Trump went further even than his recent growing calls for the Palestinians in Gaza to be ""relocated"" to Egypt and Jordan, saying that the United States would then take the territory over and rebuild it. When asked whether Palestinians would be allowed back, he said ""the world's people"" would live there, saying it would be an ""international, unbelievable place"", before adding ""also Palestinians"". His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the day summed up much of the tone around the proposal, saying of Trump ""this guy knows real estate"". Trump said it would be the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". Asked whether American troops would be involved in the take over of Gaza, Mr Trump said ""we'll do what is necessary"". His proposals amount to the most radical transformation in the US position on the territory since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the war of 1967, which saw the start of Israel's military occupation of land including the Gaza Strip. Gaza was already home to Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the wars surrounding Israel's creation. They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day. Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to ""resettle… permanently"". The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan. Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop ""Gaza being a threat to Israel"".

Another eight soldiers were wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a checkpoint in Tayasir village, 2km (1.2 miles) north of Tubas, a military statement said. The attacker was shot dead, it said. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad praised the attack as a response to the Israeli operation in Tubas, Jenin and Tulkarm, but neither said they were behind it. Meanwhile, a UN official warned the situation in Jenin's refugee camp was heading in a ""catastrophic direction"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of a large-scale operation to ""defeat terrorism"" in Jenin on 21 January, three days after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took effect. The operation was expanded into Tulkarm and Tubas last week. The Palestinian health ministry says Israeli forces have killed 70 Palestinians across the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, since the start of the year. The figure includes the 25 reported killed in the Jenin area and 13 in the Tubas and Tulkarm areas over the past two weeks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it killed about 55 ""terrorists"" and arrested 380 wanted individuals across the West Bank in January. Israeli media reported that the Palestinian who carried out Tuesday's shooting attack in Tayasir was able to sneak up to a military post next to the checkpoint before opening fire with an M16 rifle at soldiers stationed there. Soldiers fired back and a gun battle lasted several minutes before the attacker was killed, they said. The IDF named the two soldiers who were killed as Sgt Maj Ofer Yung, 39, and Sgt Maj Avraham Friedman, 43. Two of the eight wounded soldiers were in a serious condition in hospital, it said. During a visit to the scene later on Tuesday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, promised it would ""investigate and draw conclusions"" from what he described as the ""serious attack"". ""We will increase the counterterrorism activity and expand it to additional areas,"" he added. Hamas praised what it described as the ""heroic and qualitative operation carried out by a Palestinian resistance fighter"" in Tayasir, saying that it showed ""the crimes of the occupation and its aggression against the northern occupied West Bank will not go unpunished"". On Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman alleged that the Israeli operation was part of a wider effort aimed at ""displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing"". Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned of the deteriorating situation at Jenin refugee camp. Hundreds of Israeli security forces backed by helicopters, drones and armoured bulldozers have been carrying out raids in the camp, long seen as a stronghold of armed groups. ""Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,"" Ms Touma said. ""This detonation that happened on Sunday was when children were supposed to go back to school,"" she added. The IDF said on Sunday that it had ""dismantled"" 23 structures where explosives laboratories, weapons, observation posts and other infrastructure belonging to armed groups were located. Ms Touma also said that Unrwa, which has been unable to provide services in the camp since early December, had received no prior warning of the explosions from Israeli authorities. On Thursday, two laws passed by Israel's parliament last year which bans Unrwa activity on Israeli soil and forbids contact between Israeli officials and Unrwa employees came into force. Israeli officials accuse Unrwa of being complicit with Hamas - an allegation the agency denies. Ms Touma said the Israeli government had ""not communicated to Unrwa how they intend to implement"" the laws, and that Unrwa teams were currently ""staying and delivering"". There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza.

,,,reliable,,"At least 20 people, most of them women, have been killed in a car bomb attack in northern Syria, the country's presidency says. The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said a car filled with explosives blew up on a main road in the southern outskirts of the city of Manbij as a flat-bed lorry carrying about 30 agricultural workers drove past. The agency had earlier put the death toll at 15, including 11 women and three girls. Another 15 women and girls were wounded, some of them critically. The presidency vowed to ensure that the perpetrators of what it described as a ""terrorist"" attack would face the ""most severe punishments"". There was no immediate claim from any armed groups for the bombing, which was the deadliest since rebel forces overthrow president Bashar al-Assad in December. The commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance backed by the US which controls much of north-eastern Syria, condemned the attack as a ""criminal act"" that threatened the ""unity of the national fabric"". Earlier, his media chief alleged that such bombings were among the ""fundamental tactics"" used by Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), which the SDF has been battling in the Manbij area over the past two months. The SNA did not comment on the allegation. However, the Turkey-based Syrian Islamic Council accused the SDF of being behind the blast. Monday's car bombing was the second such attack in the Manbij area in only three days. On Saturday, two children and a woman were among four people killed by an explosion on a street in the city centre, the Syria Civil Defence said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that the blast was near an SNA military position and that nine people were killed, including several pro-Turkish fighters. As the Assad regime collapsed the SNA launched an offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates which the SDF had held since driving out the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in 2016. The SNA took control of Manbij on 9 December, after fighters from the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council withdrew. But since then, the SDF has tried to retake the territory by launching a counter-offensive. Turkey wants to push the SDF away from its border because it views the Kurdish militia that dominates the alliance, the People's Protection Units (YPG), as a terrorist organisation. It says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The car bombing came amid talks between Syria's transitional government and the SDF on the militia alliance's future. The commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, met President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus last week, and told the Associated Press news agency on Sunday that the two sides were negotiating with the help of Western mediators. ""Our vision of Syria is a decentralized, secular and civil country based on democracy that preserves the rights of all of its components,"" he said, referring to the country's many religious and ethnic groups. When asked whether he was prepared to dissolve the SDF, Abdi said that in principle it wanted to be part of Syria's defence ministry and part of the country's defence strategy, but that the details still had to be discussed, according to AP. Sharaa, whose Islamist group led the rebel offensive which ended Assad's 24-year rule, told Turkish TV last month that he wanted Syrian Kurdish groups to disarm. ""Preventing bloodshed and treating everyone equally is our top priority. Therefore, we believe all weapons must be under state control,"" he said.",,,,Car bomb blast in northern Syria kills at least 20,"David Gritten, BBC News",,,,,,,1

,,,reliable,,"Three Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals held by Hamas in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 have been released. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier, was reunited with her family at a military base in southern Israel after being handed over by armed Palestinian fighters to the Red Cross in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Thursday. About two hours later there was another handover in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, were pictured being escorted by fighters into a Red Cross vehicle. The Israeli military subsequently announced that they had been transferred to its forces in Gaza along with five Thai hostages and then moved to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office named the Thai nationals as agricultural workers Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao. Under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, 110 Palestinians are also being released from Israeli jails in exchange for the Israeli hostages on Thursday. The release of the Thai nationals was not part of the agreement, which began on 19 January. It should see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed in return for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza in Israeli jails during the first phase lasting six weeks. So far, 10 of those Israeli hostages - five civilians, including four women, and five female soldiers - have been freed. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Yarden Bibas, 34, was taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His family said in a statement issued after his release that he ""left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality"". His wife, Shiri, 32, and two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were four and nine-months-old on 7 October 2023, were also captured, but they have not been released. ""A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months,"" the Bibas family said. ""There are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice. Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."" American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, is a husband, father and grandfather. Originally from North Carolina, Mr Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attackers broke into Keith and his wife Aviva's home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza and dragged them away, breaking Keith's ribs and shooting him in the hand, she told the BBC. She was released from captivity in a week-long ceasefire in November 2023.",,,,Who are the Israeli and Thai hostages just released by Hamas?,No author available,,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"While held hostage by Hamas for 15 months in Gaza, 80-year-old Gadi Moses ate mainly a piece of bread and an olive twice a day, his niece Efrat Machikawa says. ""I have no idea how he survived,"" she tells the BBC. ""He lost so much weight."" He was given a small bowl of water to wash himself every five days and had to ask to use the toilet, she said. He moved frequently and was mostly alone, with Ms Machikawa saying ""loneliness is another form of torture"". He calculated maths problems in his head to distract himself, and walked up to 11 km (six miles) a day in a room, measuring the distance, she added. ""Even in the darkest times, he knew how to somehow lift himself,"" she said. ""The hope of reuniting with the family and worrying about us was the greatest power, was the only nutrition that he had for his soul."" Gadi was one of 18 hostages released so far this year as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in exchange for 583 Palestinian prisoners. The ceasefire aims to end 15 months of war in Gaza, after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 as hostages. Israel's military campaign in response killed more than 47,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN. Now, as hostages return from more than a year in captivity, details of their conditions are emerging. Accounts of limited food, with no fresh vegetables, are similar to conditions reported by Gazans during the war. Two former hostages' family members told the BBC they came back thinner. ""We're all very, very excited to have Keith back home, but very worried to see the state that he came back to us in,"" Tal Wax, the niece of 65-year-old American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who was released on Saturday, said. ""Although we can see that he is able to walk and talk we see that he has lost a lot of weight,"" she said. She heard from her cousins and Mr Siegel's wife Aviva that ""he had to endure a lot of horrible situations in captivity while still remaining the good person he is."" He is still a vegan, she added. ""Keith is very humane and he wanted to tell us he's still the same person... even after all that he's been through... He's still living up to his convictions,"" she said. ""This is just the start of his rehabilitation. We have a long way ahead of us."" Ms Machikawa said even her uncle's release was a ""terrifying"" experience. As crowds surrounded him in Gaza on Thursday, he thought it was the ""end of his life"", she said. After he was back in Israel, she was able to sleep for five hours for the first time since his capture. ""I feel like my tension is slowly melting,"" she said. On Friday, she ran to embrace her uncle in the hospital, where he gave her ""the strongest, most powerful hug"", and she let out a ""burst of tears of relief and love"". ""We understand that the uncle we know is the same one we know but even greater,"" she said, as he was talking about rehabilitation and being strong, and dreaming of returning to his fields, where he is an agricultural expert. ""Unity and family and devoting yourself for justice and a right cause are greater than anything, because I stopped my life on 7 October,"" she said. She thanked Qatar and the US for mediating the deal, and ""brave"" Red Cross workers who facilitated the releases. ""The joy is amazing"", she said, but she has mixed feelings until every hostage is back. She said ""we must eradicate terror"" and ""Israel has to secure its borders and work for a better neighbourhood and region"". ""We shall always strive to be better, to be like Gadi, to be the one that connects even in the worst times and gives the hand for the chance of better lives with everyone around us."" Few hostages freed so far this year have spoken publicly about their experiences. On Saturday, Doron Steinbrecher, who was freed two weeks ago, released a video statement. ""It will take time and it's a process - it won't end in a week or two, but I'm here thanks to you, and I'm okay,"" she said. ""I understand that everyone knows me from that terrible recording ""They caught me, they caught me, they caught me"" or as the blonde girl wearing pink"", she said. ""But I'm no longer blonde, and I won't wear pink anymore. I'm Doron, 31 years old. I'm no longer Hamas's captive, and I'm home."" To families with loved ones still in captivity, ""you are not alone"" and ""we continue to fight for you"", she added. That includes the Bibas family, who welcomed back Yarden on Saturday, but not his wife, Shiri, and two small sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were also taken hostage. Hamas had previously said they were killed in an Israeli air strike early on in the war - but they were named in a list of hostages it said in January it was willing to free. ""A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months,"" the Bibas family said in statement. ""Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."" Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country remained ""deeply concerned"" about their fate. Another 15 hostages and around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners are still due to be released in the first six weeks of the ceasefire, which started on 19 January.",,,,"'I don't know how he survived', says freed Israeli hostage's niece","Mallory Moench, BBC News, Reporting fromLondon, Alice Cuddy, International Reporter, Reporting fromIsrael",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to ""pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes"" in his first address to the nation since the fall of ousted leader Bashar al-Assad. Sharaa has been named president for a ""transitional period"", seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad. He committed to issuing a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve as a ""legal reference"" during the country's transition, following the suspension of the old constitution. On Wednesday, rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency. Sharaa began the pre-recorded speech on Thursday by saying that he would be addressing his words to all Syrian men and women, including refugees, the families of ""martyrs"" and missing people, and activists who have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a free Syria. He credited his coming to power to every Syrian who took part in the uprising and tried to make a change, and vowed to ""pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes"". He also promised to hold a ""national dialogue conference"" and vowed to preserve ""civil peace"" and Syria's territorial unity. It comes after announcements were made on Wednesday during an event in Damascus attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the ""Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution"". All rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, Sharaa said. As president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, Ghani said. In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections. He said an up-to-date census would be required first which ""would take time"" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete. Sharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a ""national dialogue conference"", which he said would ""bring together all components"" of Syrian society. In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. HTS - a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK - previously dominated the last rebel stronghold in north-western Syria. On 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia. An interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March. Also on Wednesday, the Syrian government called on Russia to address ""past mistakes"" by paying war reparations, during the first visit by a top Kremlin delegation since the fall of Assad, its staunch ally. Sharaa and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov discussed ""rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as compensation, reconstruction and recovery"", Sana reported. The Russian foreign ministry said its delegation expressed ""unwavering support"" for Syria's unity and readiness to assist its recovery from the civil war. The Russian military carried out tens of thousands of air strikes on rebel-held areas after intervening in the conflict in support of Assad in 2015. A UK-based monitoring group says more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed by those strikes and other Russian operations. Since the fall of the Assad regime, Russia has been withdrawing troops and weapons from its two bases on Syria's Mediterranean coast - Hmeimim airbase near Latakia and the naval base in Tartous. Recent satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify showed that two Russian warships were docked at Tartous, which experts said suggested an evacuation of the facility had begun. However, Russia is believed to be seeking to retain both bases, which give it a strategically important foothold in the eastern Mediterranean.",,,,Sharaa vows to pursue criminals as Syria's transitional president,"George Wright, BBC News",,,,,,,1
,,,reliable,,"A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 15 months says she was detained for some time at United Nations facilities. During a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Damari - who was released earlier this month - said she was held at sites belonging to the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). She also said she was denied medical treatment during her captivity, despite being shot in the hand and leg. In a statement, Unrwa said claims that hostages had been held on UN premises were ""very serious"" and that it had repeatedly called for independent investigations into claims Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, were misusing the facilities. Israel has repeatedly accused personnel from Unrwa of being involved in the 7 October attacks and said that its buildings in Gaza were used by Hamas. The Israeli government plans to ban the organisation from operating. During the call with Downing Street, Ms Damari said that while being held at an Unrwa facility, her captors only provided her with an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat gunshot wounds in her leg and her left hand, on which she lost two fingers.",,,,British-Israeli hostage says Hamas held her at UN facilities,"Robert Greenall, BBC News",,,,,,,1
